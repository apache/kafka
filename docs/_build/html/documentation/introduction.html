<ol class="arabic simple">

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">What is Kafka good for?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-kafka-good-for" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Kafka is generally used for two broad classes of applications:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data
between systems or applications</li>
<li>Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to
the streams of data</li>
</ul>
<p>To understand how Kafka does these things, let&#8217;s dive in and explore
Kafka&#8217;s capabilities from the bottom up.</p>
<p>First a few concepts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Kafka is run as a cluster on one or more servers that can span
multiple datacenters.</li>
<li>The Kafka cluster stores streams of <em>records</em> in categories called
<em>topics</em>.</li>
<li>Each record consists of a key, a value, and a timestamp.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kafka has four core APIs:</p>
<div style="overflow: hidden;"><ul class="simple">
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="/documentation.html#producerapi">Producer API</a> allows an
application to publish a stream of records to one or more Kafka
topics.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="/documentation.html#consumerapi">Consumer API</a> allows an
application to subscribe to one or more topics and process the stream
of records produced to them.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="/documentation/streams">Streams API</a> allows an application to
act as a <em>stream processor</em>, consuming an input stream from one or
more topics and producing an output stream to one or more output
topics, effectively transforming the input streams to output streams.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="/documentation.html#connect">Connector API</a> allows building
and running reusable producers or consumers that connect Kafka topics
to existing applications or data systems. For example, a connector to
a relational database might capture every change to a table.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Kafka the communication between the clients and the servers is done
with a simple, high-performance, language agnostic <a class="reference external" href="https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html">TCP
protocol</a>. This protocol is
versioned and maintains backwards compatibility with older version. We
provide a Java client for Kafka, but clients are available in <a class="reference external" href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Clients">many
languages</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="topics-and-logs">
<span id="intro-topics"></span><h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Topics and Logs</a><a class="headerlink" href="#topics-and-logs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s first dive into the core abstraction Kafka provides for a stream
of records—the topic.</p>
<p>A topic is a category or feed name to which records are published.
Topics in Kafka are always multi-subscriber; that is, a topic can have
zero, one, or many consumers that subscribe to the data written to it.</p>
<p>For each topic, the Kafka cluster maintains a partitioned log that looks
like this:</p>
<p>Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records that is
continually appended to—a structured commit log. The records in the
partitions are each assigned a sequential id number called the <em>offset</em>
that uniquely identifies each record within the partition.</p>
<p>The Kafka cluster durably persists all published records—whether or not
they have been consumed—using a configurable retention period. For
example, if the retention policy is set to two days, then for the two
days after a record is published, it is available for consumption, after
which it will be discarded to free up space. Kafka&#8217;s performance is
effectively constant with respect to data size so storing data for a
long time is not a problem.</p>
<p>In fact, the only metadata retained on a per-consumer basis is the
offset or position of that consumer in the log. This offset is
controlled by the consumer: normally a consumer will advance its offset
linearly as it reads records, but, in fact, since the position is
controlled by the consumer it can consume records in any order it likes.
For example a consumer can reset to an older offset to reprocess data
from the past or skip ahead to the most recent record and start
consuming from &#8220;now&#8221;.</p>
<p>This combination of features means that Kafka consumers are very
cheap—they can come and go without much impact on the cluster or on
other consumers. For example, you can use our command line tools to
&#8220;tail&#8221; the contents of any topic without changing what is consumed by
any existing consumers.</p>
<p>The partitions in the log serve several purposes. First, they allow the
log to scale beyond a size that will fit on a single server. Each
individual partition must fit on the servers that host it, but a topic
may have many partitions so it can handle an arbitrary amount of data.
Second they act as the unit of parallelism—more on that in a bit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="distribution">
<span id="intro-distribution"></span><h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Distribution</a><a class="headerlink" href="#distribution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The partitions of the log are distributed over the servers in the Kafka
cluster with each server handling data and requests for a share of the
partitions. Each partition is replicated across a configurable number of
servers for fault tolerance.</p>
<p>Each partition has one server which acts as the &#8220;leader&#8221; and zero or
more servers which act as &#8220;followers&#8221;. The leader handles all read and
write requests for the partition while the followers passively replicate
the leader. If the leader fails, one of the followers will automatically
become the new leader. Each server acts as a leader for some of its
partitions and a follower for others so load is well balanced within the
cluster.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="geo-replication">
<span id="intro-geo-replication"></span><h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Geo-Replication</a><a class="headerlink" href="#geo-replication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Kafka MirrorMaker provides geo-replication support for your clusters.
With MirrorMaker, messages are replicated across multiple datacenters or
cloud regions. You can use this in active/passive scenarios for backup
and recovery; or in active/active scenarios to place data closer to your
users, or support data locality requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="producers">
<span id="intro-producers"></span><h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Producers</a><a class="headerlink" href="#producers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Producers publish data to the topics of their choice. The producer is
responsible for choosing which record to assign to which partition
within the topic. This can be done in a round-robin fashion simply to
balance load or it can be done according to some semantic partition
function (say based on some key in the record). More on the use of
partitioning in a second!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="consumers">
<span id="intro-consumers"></span><h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Consumers</a><a class="headerlink" href="#consumers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Consumers label themselves with a <em>consumer group</em> name, and each record
published to a topic is delivered to one consumer instance within each
subscribing consumer group. Consumer instances can be in separate
processes or on separate machines.</p>
<p>If all the consumer instances have the same consumer group, then the
records will effectively be load balanced over the consumer instances.</p>
<p>If all the consumer instances have different consumer groups, then each
record will be broadcast to all the consumer processes.</p>
<p>A two server Kafka cluster hosting four partitions (P0-P3) with two
consumer groups. Consumer group A has two consumer instances and group B
has four.</p>
<p>More commonly, however, we have found that topics have a small number of
consumer groups, one for each &#8220;logical subscriber&#8221;. Each group is
composed of many consumer instances for scalability and fault tolerance.
This is nothing more than publish-subscribe semantics where the
subscriber is a cluster of consumers instead of a single process.</p>
<p>The way consumption is implemented in Kafka is by dividing up the
partitions in the log over the consumer instances so that each instance
is the exclusive consumer of a &#8220;fair share&#8221; of partitions at any point
in time. This process of maintaining membership in the group is handled
by the Kafka protocol dynamically. If new instances join the group they
will take over some partitions from other members of the group; if an
instance dies, its partitions will be distributed to the remaining
instances.</p>
<p>Kafka only provides a total order over records <em>within</em> a partition, not
between different partitions in a topic. Per-partition ordering combined
with the ability to partition data by key is sufficient for most
applications. However, if you require a total order over records this
can be achieved with a topic that has only one partition, though this
will mean only one consumer process per consumer group.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multi-tenancy">
<span id="intro-multi-tenancy"></span><h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Multi-tenancy</a><a class="headerlink" href="#multi-tenancy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can deploy Kafka as a multi-tenant solution. Multi-tenancy is
enabled by configuring which topics can produce or consume data. There
is also operations support for quotas. Administrators can define and
enforce quotas on requests to control the broker resources that are used
by clients. For more information, see the <a class="reference external" href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security">security
documentation</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="guarantees">
<span id="intro-guarantees"></span><h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Guarantees</a><a class="headerlink" href="#guarantees" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At a high-level Kafka gives the following guarantees:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Messages sent by a producer to a particular topic partition will be
appended in the order they are sent. That is, if a record M1 is sent
by the same producer as a record M2, and M1 is sent first, then M1
will have a lower offset than M2 and appear earlier in the log.</li>
<li>A consumer instance sees records in the order they are stored in the
log.</li>
<li>For a topic with replication factor N, we will tolerate up to N-1
server failures without losing any records committed to the log.</li>
</ul>
<p>More details on these guarantees are given in the design section of the
documentation.</p>

<div class="section" id="kafka-as-a-messaging-system">
<span id="kafka-mq"></span><h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Kafka as a Messaging System</a><a class="headerlink" href="#kafka-as-a-messaging-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>How does Kafka&#8217;s notion of streams compare to a traditional enterprise
messaging system?</p>
<p>Messaging traditionally has two models:
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue">queuing</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">publish-subscribe</a>.
In a queue, a pool of consumers may read from a server and each record
goes to one of them; in publish-subscribe the record is broadcast to all
consumers. Each of these two models has a strength and a weakness. The
strength of queuing is that it allows you to divide up the processing of
data over multiple consumer instances, which lets you scale your
processing. Unfortunately, queues aren&#8217;t multi-subscriber—once one
process reads the data it&#8217;s gone. Publish-subscribe allows you broadcast
data to multiple processes, but has no way of scaling processing since
every message goes to every subscriber.</p>
<p>The consumer group concept in Kafka generalizes these two concepts. As
with a queue the consumer group allows you to divide up processing over
a collection of processes (the members of the consumer group). As with
publish-subscribe, Kafka allows you to broadcast messages to multiple
consumer groups.</p>
<p>The advantage of Kafka&#8217;s model is that every topic has both these
properties—it can scale processing and is also multi-subscriber—there is
no need to choose one or the other.</p>
<p>Kafka has stronger ordering guarantees than a traditional messaging
system, too.</p>
<p>A traditional queue retains records in-order on the server, and if
multiple consumers consume from the queue then the server hands out
records in the order they are stored. However, although the server hands
out records in order, the records are delivered asynchronously to
consumers, so they may arrive out of order on different consumers. This
effectively means the ordering of the records is lost in the presence of
parallel consumption. Messaging systems often work around this by having
a notion of &#8220;exclusive consumer&#8221; that allows only one process to consume
from a queue, but of course this means that there is no parallelism in
processing.</p>
<p>Kafka does it better. By having a notion of parallelism—the
partition—within the topics, Kafka is able to provide both ordering
guarantees and load balancing over a pool of consumer processes. This is
achieved by assigning the partitions in the topic to the consumers in
the consumer group so that each partition is consumed by exactly one
consumer in the group. By doing this we ensure that the consumer is the
only reader of that partition and consumes the data in order. Since
there are many partitions this still balances the load over many
consumer instances. Note however that there cannot be more consumer
instances in a consumer group than partitions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="kafka-as-a-storage-system">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Kafka as a Storage System</a><a class="headerlink" href="#kafka-as-a-storage-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Any message queue that allows publishing messages decoupled from
consuming them is effectively acting as a storage system for the
in-flight messages. What is different about Kafka is that it is a very
good storage system.</p>
<p>Data written to Kafka is written to disk and replicated for
fault-tolerance. Kafka allows producers to wait on acknowledgement so
that a write isn&#8217;t considered complete until it is fully replicated and
guaranteed to persist even if the server written to fails.</p>
<p>The disk structures Kafka uses scale well—Kafka will perform the same
whether you have 50 KB or 50 TB of persistent data on the server.</p>
<p>As a result of taking storage seriously and allowing the clients to
control their read position, you can think of Kafka as a kind of special
purpose distributed filesystem dedicated to high-performance,
low-latency commit log storage, replication, and propagation.</p>

<div class="section" id="kafka-for-stream-processing">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Kafka for Stream Processing</a><a class="headerlink" href="#kafka-for-stream-processing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It isn&#8217;t enough to just read, write, and store streams of data, the
purpose is to enable real-time processing of streams.</p>
<p>In Kafka a stream processor is anything that takes continual streams of
data from input topics, performs some processing on this input, and
produces continual streams of data to output topics.</p>
<p>For example, a retail application might take in input streams of sales
and shipments, and output a stream of reorders and price adjustments
computed off this data.</p>
<p>It is possible to do simple processing directly using the producer and
consumer APIs. However for more complex transformations Kafka provides a
fully integrated <a class="reference external" href="/documentation/streams">Streams API</a>. This allows
building applications that do non-trivial processing that compute
aggregations off of streams or join streams together.</p>
<p>This facility helps solve the hard problems this type of application
faces: handling out-of-order data, reprocessing input as code changes,
performing stateful computations, etc.</p>
<p>The streams API builds on the core primitives Kafka provides: it uses
the producer and consumer APIs for input, uses Kafka for stateful
storage, and uses the same group mechanism for fault tolerance among the
stream processor instances.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="putting-the-pieces-together">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Putting the Pieces Together</a><a class="headerlink" href="#putting-the-pieces-together" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This combination of messaging, storage, and stream processing may seem
unusual but it is essential to Kafka&#8217;s role as a streaming platform.</p>
<p>A distributed file system like HDFS allows storing static files for
batch processing. Effectively a system like this allows storing and
processing <em>historical</em> data from the past.</p>
<p>A traditional enterprise messaging system allows processing future
messages that will arrive after you subscribe. Applications built in
this way process future data as it arrives.</p>
<p>Kafka combines both of these capabilities, and the combination is
critical both for Kafka usage as a platform for streaming applications
as well as for streaming data pipelines.</p>
<p>By combining storage and low-latency subscriptions, streaming
applications can treat both past and future data the same way. That is a
single application can process historical, stored data but rather than
ending when it reaches the last record it can keep processing as future
data arrives. This is a generalized notion of stream processing that
subsumes batch processing as well as message-driven applications.</p>
<p>Likewise for streaming data pipelines the combination of subscription to
real-time events make it possible to use Kafka for very low-latency
pipelines; but the ability to store data reliably make it possible to
use it for critical data where the delivery of data must be guaranteed
or for integration with offline systems that load data only periodically
or may go down for extended periods of time for maintenance. The stream
processing facilities make it possible to transform data as it arrives.</p>

provides see the rest of the <a class="reference external" href="/documentation.html">documentation</a>.</p>
