/**
 * A callback interface that the user can implement to trigger custom actions when the set of partitions assigned to the
 * consumer changes.
 * <p>
 * This is applicable when the consumer is having Kafka auto-manage group membership. If the consumer directly assigns partitions,
 * those partitions will never be reassigned and this callback is not applicable.
 * <p>
 * When Kafka is managing the group membership, a partition re-assignment will be triggered whenever the members of the group change or the subscription
 * of the members changes. This can occur when processes die, new process instances are added or old instances come back to life after failure.
 * Partition re-assignments can also be triggered by changes affecting the subscribed topics (e.g. when the number of partitions is
 * administratively adjusted).
 * <p>
 * There are many uses for this functionality. One common use is saving offsets in a custom store. By saving offsets in
 * the {@link #onPartitionsRevoked(Collection)} call, we can ensure that any time partition assignment changes
 * the offset gets saved.
 * <p>
 * Another use is flushing out any kind of cache of intermediate results the consumer may be keeping. For example,
 * consider a case where the consumer subscribes to a topic containing user page views, and the goal is to count the
 * number of page views per user for each five-minute window. Let's say the topic is partitioned by the user id so that
 * all events for a particular user go to a single consumer instance. The consumer can keep in memory a running
 * tally of actions per user and only flush these out to a remote data store when its cache gets too big. However, if a
 * partition is reassigned, it may want to automatically trigger a flush of this cache before the new owner takes over
 * consumption.
 * <p>
 * This callback will only execute in the user thread as part of the {@link Consumer#poll(java.time.Duration) poll(long)} call
 * whenever partition assignment changes.
 * <p>
 * Under normal conditions, if a partition is reassigned from one consumer to another, then the old consumer will
 * always invoke {@link #onPartitionsRevoked(Collection) onPartitionsRevoked} for that partition prior to the new consumer
 * invoking {@link #onPartitionsAssigned(Collection) onPartitionsAssigned} for the same partition. So if offsets or other states are saved in the
 * {@link #onPartitionsRevoked(Collection) onPartitionsRevoked} call by one consumer member, it will be always accessible by the time other consumer
 * taking over that partition **gets a call to** its {@link #onPartitionsAssigned(Collection) onPartitionsAssigned} callback to load the state.
 * <p>
 * You can think of revocation as a graceful way to give up ownership of a partition. In some cases, the consumer may not have an opportunity to do so.
 * For example, if the session times out, then the partitions may be reassigned before we have a chance to revoke them gracefully.
 * In this case, we have a third callback {@link #onPartitionsLost(Collection)}. The difference between this function and
 * {@link #onPartitionsRevoked(Collection)} is that upon invocation of {@link #onPartitionsLost(Collection)}, the partitions
 * may already be owned by some other members in the same group and therefore users would not be able to commit its consumed offsets for example.
 * Users could implement these two functions differently (by default,
 * {@link #onPartitionsLost(Collection)} will be calling {@link #onPartitionsRevoked(Collection)} directly); for example, in the
 * {@link #onPartitionsLost(Collection)} we should not need to store the offsets since we know these partitions are no longer owned by the consumer
 * at that time.
 * <p>
 * During a rebalance event, the {@link #onPartitionsAssigned(Collection) onPartitionsAssigned} function will always be triggered exactly once when
 * the rebalance completes. That is, even if there is no newly assigned partitions for a consumer member, its {@link #onPartitionsAssigned(Collection) onPartitionsAssigned}
 * will still be triggered with an empty collection of partitions. As a result this function can be used also to notify when a rebalance event has happened.
 * With eager rebalancing, {@link #onPartitionsRevoked(Collection)} will always be called at the start of a rebalance. On the other hand, {@link #onPartitionsLost(Collection)}
 * will only be called when there were non-empty partitions that were lost.
 * With cooperative rebalancing, {@link #onPartitionsRevoked(Collection)} and {@link #onPartitionsLost(Collection)}
 * will only be triggered when there are non-empty partitions revoked or lost from this consumer member during a rebalance event.
 * <p>
 * It is possible
 * for a {@link org.apache.kafka.common.errors.WakeupException} or {@link org.apache.kafka.common.errors.InterruptException}
 * to be raised from one of these nested invocations. In this case, the exception will be propagated to the current
 * invocation of {@link KafkaConsumer#poll(java.time.Duration)} in which this callback is being executed. This means it is not
 * necessary to catch these exceptions and re-attempt to wakeup or interrupt the consumer thread.
 * Also, if the callback function implementation itself throws an exception, this exception will be propagated to the current
 * invocation of {@link KafkaConsumer#poll(java.time.Duration)} as well.
 * <p>
 * Note those callbacks only serve as notification of an assignment change.
 * They cannot be used to express acceptance of the change.
 * Hence, throwing an exception from a callback does not affect the assignment in any way,
 * as it will be propagated all the way up to the {@link KafkaConsumer#poll(java.time.Duration)} call.
 * If user captures the exception in the caller, the callback is still assumed successful and no further retries will be attempted.
 * <p>
 *
 * Here is pseudo-code for a callback implementation for saving offsets:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *   public class SaveOffsetsOnRebalance implements ConsumerRebalanceListener {
 *       private Consumer<?,?> consumer;
 *
 *       public SaveOffsetsOnRebalance(Consumer<?,?> consumer) {
 *           this.consumer = consumer;
 *       }
 *
 *       public void onPartitionsRevoked(Collection<TopicPartition> partitions) {
 *           // save the offsets in an external store using some custom code not described here
 *           for(TopicPartition partition: partitions)
 *              saveOffsetInExternalStore(consumer.position(partition));
 *       }
 *
 *       public void onPartitionsLost(Collection<TopicPartition> partitions) {
 *           // do not need to save the offsets since these partitions are probably owned by other consumers already
 *       }
 *
 *       public void onPartitionsAssigned(Collection<TopicPartition> partitions) {
 *           // read the offsets from an external store using some custom code not described here
 *           for(TopicPartition partition: partitions)
 *              consumer.seek(partition, readOffsetFromExternalStore(partition));
 *       }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
