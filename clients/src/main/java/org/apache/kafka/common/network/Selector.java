/**
 * A nioSelector interface for doing non-blocking multi-connection network I/O.
 * <p>
 * This class works with {@link NetworkSend} and {@link NetworkReceive} to transmit size-delimited network requests and
 * responses.
 * <p>
 * A connection can be added to the nioSelector associated with an integer id by doing
 *
 * <pre>
 * nioSelector.connect(&quot;42&quot;, new InetSocketAddress(&quot;google.com&quot;, server.port), 64000, 64000);
 * </pre>
 *
 * The connect call does not block on the creation of the TCP connection, so the connect method only begins initiating
 * the connection. The successful invocation of this method does not mean a valid connection has been established.
 *
 * Sending requests, receiving responses, processing connection completions, and disconnections on the existing
 * connections are all done using the <code>poll()</code> call.
 *
 * <pre>
 * nioSelector.send(new NetworkSend(myDestination, myBytes));
 * nioSelector.send(new NetworkSend(myOtherDestination, myOtherBytes));
 * nioSelector.poll(TIMEOUT_MS);
 * </pre>
 *
 * The nioSelector maintains several lists that are reset by each call to <code>poll()</code> which are available via
 * various getters. These are reset by each call to <code>poll()</code>.
 *
 * This class is not thread safe!

     * This requires additional buffers to be maintained as we are reading from network, since the data on the wire is encrypted
     * we won't be able to read exact no.of bytes as kafka protocol requires. We read as many bytes as we can, up to SSLEngine's
     * application buffer size. This means we might be reading additional bytes than the requested size.
     * If there is no further data to read from socketChannel selector won't invoke that channel and we've have additional bytes
     * in the buffer. To overcome this issue we added "stagedReceives" map which contains per-channel deque. When we are
     * reading a channel we read as many responses as we can and store them into "stagedReceives" and pop one response during
     * the poll to add the completedReceives. If there are any active channels in the "stagedReceives" we set "timeout" to 0
     * and pop response and add to the completedReceives.

     * requests from a channel are processed on the broker in the order they are sent. Since outstanding requests added
