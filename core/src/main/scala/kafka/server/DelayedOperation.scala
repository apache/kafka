/**
 * An operation whose processing needs to be delayed for at most the given delayMs. For example
 * a delayed produce operation could be waiting for specified number of acks; or
 * a delayed fetch operation could be waiting for a given number of bytes to accumulate.
 *
 * The logic upon completing a delayed operation is defined in onComplete() and will be called exactly once.
 * Once an operation is completed, isCompleted() will return true. onComplete() can be triggered by either
 * forceComplete(), which forces calling onComplete() after delayMs if the operation is not yet completed,
 * or tryComplete(), which first checks if the operation can be completed or not now, and if yes calls
 * forceComplete().
 *
 * A subclass of DelayedOperation needs to provide an implementation of both onComplete() and tryComplete().
 *
 * Noted that if you add a future delayed operation that calls ReplicaManager.appendRecords() in onComplete()
 * like DelayedJoin, you must be aware that this operation's onExpiration() needs to call actionQueue.tryCompleteAction().

    //
    // ==============[story about lock]==============
    // Through safeTryCompleteOrElse(), we hold the operation's lock while adding the operation to watch list and doing
    // the tryComplete() check. This is to avoid a potential deadlock between the callers to tryCompleteElseWatch() and
    // checkAndComplete(). For example, the following deadlock can happen if the lock is only held for the final tryComplete()
    // 1) thread_a holds readlock of stateLock from TransactionStateManager
    // 2) thread_a is executing tryCompleteElseWatch()
    // 3) thread_a adds op to watch list
    // 4) thread_b requires writelock of stateLock from TransactionStateManager (blocked by thread_a)
    // 5) thread_c calls checkAndComplete() and holds lock of op
    // 6) thread_c is waiting readlock of stateLock to complete op (blocked by thread_b)
    // 7) thread_a is waiting lock of op to call the final tryComplete() (blocked by thread_c)
    //
    // Note that even with the current approach, deadlocks could still be introduced. For example,
    // 1) thread_a calls tryCompleteElseWatch() and gets lock of op
    // 2) thread_a adds op to watch list
    // 3) thread_a calls op#tryComplete and tries to require lock_b
    // 4) thread_b holds lock_b and calls checkAndComplete()
    // 5) thread_b sees op from watch list
    // 6) thread_b needs lock of op
    // To avoid the above scenario, we recommend DelayedOperationPurgatory.checkAndComplete() be called without holding
    // any exclusive lock. Since DelayedOperationPurgatory.checkAndComplete() completes delayed operations asynchronously,
