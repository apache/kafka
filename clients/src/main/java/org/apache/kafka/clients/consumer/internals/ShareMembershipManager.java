/**
 * Group manager for a single consumer that has a group id defined in the config
 * {@link ConsumerConfig#GROUP_ID_CONFIG} and the share group protocol to get automatically
 * assigned partitions when calling the subscribe API.
 * <p/>
 *
 * While the subscribe API hasn't been called (or if the consumer called unsubscribe), this manager
 * will only be responsible for keeping the member in the {@link MemberState#UNSUBSCRIBED} state,
 * without joining the group.
 * <p/>
 *
 * If the consumer subscribe API is called, this manager will use the {@link #groupId()} to join the
 * share group, and based on the share group protocol heartbeats, will handle the full
 * lifecycle of the member as it joins the group, reconciles assignments, handles fatal errors,
 * and leaves the group.
 * <p/>
 *
 * Reconciliation process:<p/>
 * The member accepts all assignments received from the broker, resolves topic names from
 * metadata, reconciles the resolved assignments, and keeps the unresolved to be reconciled when
 * discovered with a metadata update. Reconciliations of resolved assignments are executed
 * sequentially and acknowledged to the server as they complete. The reconciliation process
 * involves multiple async operations, so the member will continue to heartbeat while these
 * operations complete, to make sure that the member stays in the group while reconciling.
 * <p/>
 *
 * Reconciliation steps:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Resolve topic names for all topic IDs received in the target assignment. Topic names
 *     found in metadata are then ready to be reconciled. Topic IDs not found are kept as
 *     unresolved, and the member request metadata updates until it resolves them (or the broker
 *     removes it from the target assignment).</li>
 *     <li>When the above steps complete, the member acknowledges the reconciled assignment,
 *     which is the subset of the target that was resolved from metadata and actually reconciled.
 *     The ack is performed by sending a heartbeat request back to the broker.</li>
 * </ol>
