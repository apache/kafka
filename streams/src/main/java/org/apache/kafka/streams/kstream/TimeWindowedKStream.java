/**
 * {@code TimeWindowedKStream} is an abstraction of a <i>windowed</i> record stream of {@link KeyValue} pairs.
 * It is an intermediate representation after a grouping and windowing of a {@link KStream} before an aggregation is
 * applied to the new (partitioned) windows resulting in a windowed {@link KTable} (a <emph>windowed</emph>
 * {@code KTable} is a {@link KTable} with key type {@link Windowed Windowed<K>}).
 * <p>
 * The specified {@code windows} define either hopping time windows that can be overlapping or tumbling (c.f.
 * {@link TimeWindows}) or they define landmark windows (c.f. {@link UnlimitedWindows}).
 * <p>
 * The result is written into a local {@link WindowStore} (which is basically an ever-updating
 * materialized view) that can be queried using the name provided in the {@link Materialized} instance.
 * Furthermore, updates to the store are sent downstream into a windowed {@link KTable} changelog stream, where
 * "windowed" implies that the {@link KTable} key is a combined key of the original record key and a window ID.
 * New events are added to {@link TimeWindows} until their grace period ends (see {@link TimeWindows#grace(Duration)}).
 * <p>
 * A {@code TimeWindowedKStream} must be obtained from a {@link KGroupedStream} via
 * {@link KGroupedStream#windowedBy(Windows)}.
 *
 * @param <K> Type of keys
 * @param <V> Type of values
