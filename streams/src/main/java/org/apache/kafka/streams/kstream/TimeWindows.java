/**
 * The fixed-size time-based window specifications used for aggregations.
 * <p>
 * The semantics of time-based aggregation windows are: Every T1 (advance) milliseconds, compute the aggregate total for
 * T2 (size) milliseconds.
 * <ul>
 *     <li> If {@code advance < size} a hopping windows is defined:<br />
 *          it discretize a stream into overlapping windows, which implies that a record maybe contained in one and or
 *          more "adjacent" windows.</li>
 *     <li> If {@code advance == size} a tumbling window is defined:<br />
 *          it discretize a stream into non-overlapping windows, which implies that a record is only ever contained in
 *          one and only one tumbling window.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Thus, the specified {@code TimeWindow}s are aligned to the epoch.
 * Aligned to the epoch means, that the first window starts at timestamp zero.
 * For example, hopping windows with size of 5000ms and advance of 3000ms, have window boundaries
 * [0;5000),[3000;8000),... and not [1000;6000),[4000;9000),... or even something "random" like [1452;6452),[4452;9452),...
 * <p>
 * For time semantics, see {@link TimestampExtractor}.
