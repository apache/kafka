# Upgrade

## Upgrading to 3.4.0 from any version 0.8.x through 3.3.x {#upgrade_3_4_0}

**If you are upgrading from a version prior to 2.1.x, please see the
note below about the change to the schema used to store consumer
offsets. Once you have changed the inter.broker.protocol.version to the
latest version, it will not be possible to downgrade to a version prior
to 2.1.**

**For a rolling upgrade:**

1.  Update server.properties on all brokers and add the following
    properties. CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION refers to the version you are
    upgrading from. CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION refers to the message
    format version currently in use. If you have previously overridden
    the message format version, you should keep its current value.
    Alternatively, if you are upgrading from a version prior to
    0.11.0.x, then CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION should be set to match
    CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. `3.3`,
        `3.2`, etc.)
    -   log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See
        [potential performance impact following the upgrade](#upgrade_10_performance_impact) for the details on what
        this configuration does.)

    If you are upgrading from version 0.11.0.x or above, and you have
    not overridden the message format, then you only need to override
    the inter-broker protocol version.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. `3.3`,
        `3.2`, etc.)
2.  Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the
    code, and restart it. Once you have done so, the brokers will be
    running the latest version and you can verify that the cluster\'s
    behavior and performance meets expectations. It is still possible to
    downgrade at this point if there are any problems.
3.  Once the cluster\'s behavior and performance has been verified, bump
    the protocol version by editing `inter.broker.protocol.version` and
    setting it to `3.4`.
4.  Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take
    effect. Once the brokers begin using the latest protocol version, it
    will no longer be possible to downgrade the cluster to an older
    version.
5.  If you have overridden the message format version as instructed
    above, then you need to do one more rolling restart to upgrade it to
    its latest version. Once all (or most) consumers have been upgraded
    to 0.11.0 or later, change log.message.format.version to 3.4 on each
    broker and restart them one by one. Note that the older Scala
    clients, which are no longer maintained, do not support the message
    format introduced in 0.11, so to avoid conversion costs (or to take
    advantage of [exactly once semantics](#upgrade_11_exactly_once_semantics)), the newer Java
    clients must be used.

## Upgrading a KRaft-based cluster to 3.4.0 from any version 3.0.x through 3.3.x {#upgrade_kraft_3_4_0}

**If you are upgrading from a version prior to 3.3.0, please see the
note below. Once you have changed the metadata.version to the latest
version, it will not be possible to downgrade to a version prior to
3.3-IV0.**

**For a rolling upgrade:**

1.  Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the
    code, and restart it. Once you have done so, the brokers will be
    running the latest version and you can verify that the cluster\'s
    behavior and performance meets expectations.
2.  Once the cluster\'s behavior and performance has been verified, bump
    the metadata.version by running
    `./bin/kafka-features.sh upgrade --metadata 3.4`
3.  Note that the cluster metadata version cannot be downgraded to a
    pre-production 3.0.x, 3.1.x, or 3.2.x version once it has been
    upgraded. However, it is possible to downgrade to production
    versions such as 3.3-IV0, 3.3-IV1, etc.

## Upgrading to 3.3.1 from any version 0.8.x through 3.2.x {#upgrade_3_3_1}

**If you are upgrading from a version prior to 2.1.x, please see the
note below about the change to the schema used to store consumer
offsets. Once you have changed the inter.broker.protocol.version to the

    clients must be used.

## Upgrading a KRaft-based cluster to 3.3.1 from any version 3.0.x through 3.2.x {#upgrade_kraft_3_3_1}

**If you are upgrading from a version prior to 3.3.1, please see the
note below. Once you have changed the metadata.version to the latest
version, it will not be possible to downgrade to a version prior to
3.3-IV0.**

    upgraded. However, it is possible to downgrade to production
    versions such as 3.3-IV0, 3.3-IV1, etc.

### Notable changes in 3.4.0 {#upgrade_340_notable}

-   Since Apache Kafka 3.4.0, we have added a system property
    (\"org.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules\") to disable the
    problematic login modules usage in SASL JAAS configuration. Also by
    default \"com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule\" is disabled
    from Apache Kafka 3.4.0.

### Notable changes in 3.3.1 {#upgrade_331_notable}

-   KRaft mode is production ready for new clusters. See
    [KIP-833](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-833%3A+Mark+KRaft+as+Production+Ready)
    for more details (including limitations).
-   The partitioner used by default for records with no keys has been
    improved to avoid pathological behavior when one or more brokers are
    slow. The new logic may affect the batching behavior, which can be
    tuned using the `batch.size` and/or `linger.ms` configuration
    settings. The previous behavior can be restored by setting
    `partitioner.class=org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.DefaultPartitioner`.
    See
    [KIP-794](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-794%3A+Strictly+Uniform+Sticky+Partitioner)
    for more details.
-   There is now a slightly different upgrade process for KRaft clusters
    than for ZK-based clusters, as described above.
-   Introduced a new API `addMetricIfAbsent` to `Metrics` which would
    create a new Metric if not existing or return the same metric if
    already registered. Note that this behaviour is different from
    `addMetric` API which throws an `IllegalArgumentException` when
    trying to create an already existing metric. (See
    [KIP-843](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-843%3A+Adding+addMetricIfAbsent+method+to+Metrics)
    for more details).

## Upgrading to 3.2.0 from any version 0.8.x through 3.1.x {#upgrade_3_2_0}

**If you are upgrading from a version prior to 2.1.x, please see the
note below about the change to the schema used to store consumer

    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. `3.1`,
        `3.0`, etc.)
    -   log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See
        [potential performance impact following the upgrade](#upgrade_10_performance_impact) for the details on what
        this configuration does.)

    If you are upgrading from version 0.11.0.x or above, and you have
    not overridden the message format, then you only need to override
    the inter-broker protocol version.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. `3.1`, `3.0`, etc.)

    format introduced in 0.11, so to avoid conversion costs (or to take
    advantage of [exactly once semantics](#upgrade_11_exactly_once_semantics)), the newer Java
    clients must be used.

### Notable changes in 3.2.0 {#upgrade_320_notable}

-   Idempotence for the producer is enabled by default if no conflicting
    configurations are set. When producing to brokers older than 2.8.0,
    the `IDEMPOTENT_WRITE` permission is required. Check the
    compatibility section of
    [KIP-679](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-679%3A+Producer+will+enable+the+strongest+delivery+guarantee+by+default#KIP679:Producerwillenablethestrongestdeliveryguaranteebydefault-Compatibility,Deprecation,andMigrationPlan)
    for details. In 3.0.0 and 3.1.0, a bug prevented this default from being applied, which meant that idempotence remained disabled unless the user had explicitly set `enable.idempotence` to true
    (See
    [KAFKA-13598](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13598) for
    more details). This issue was fixed and the default is properly
    applied in 3.0.1, 3.1.1, and 3.2.0.
-   A notable exception is Connect that by default disables idempotent
    behavior for all of its producers in order to uniformly support
    using a wide range of Kafka broker versions. Users can change this
    behavior to enable idempotence for some or all producers via Connect
    worker and/or connector configuration. Connect may enable idempotent
    producers by default in a future major release.
-   Kafka has replaced log4j with reload4j due to security concerns.
    This only affects modules that specify a logging backend
    (`connect-runtime` and `kafka-tools` are two such examples). A
    number of modules, including `kafka-clients`, leave it to the
    application to specify the logging backend. More information can be
    found at [reload4j](https://reload4j.qos.ch). Projects that depend
    on the affected modules from the Kafka project should use
    [slf4j-log4j12 version 1.7.35 or
    above](https://www.slf4j.org/manual.html#swapping) or slf4j-reload4j
    to avoid [possible compatibility issues originating from the logging
    framework](https://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#no_tlm).
-   The example connectors, `FileStreamSourceConnector` and
    `FileStreamSinkConnector`, have been removed from the default
    classpath. To use them in Kafka Connect standalone or distributed
    mode they need to be explicitly added, for example
    `CLASSPATH=./lib/connect-file-3.2.0.jar ./bin/connect-distributed.sh`.

## Upgrading to 3.1.0 from any version 0.8.x through 3.0.x {#upgrade_3_1_0}

**If you are upgrading from a version prior to 2.1.x, please see the
note below about the change to the schema used to store consumer

        `2.8`, etc.)
    -   log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See
        [potential performance impact following the upgrade](#upgrade_10_performance_impact) 
        for the details on what this configuration does.)

    If you are upgrading from version 0.11.0.x or above, and you have
    not overridden the message format, then you only need to override

    to avoid [possible compatibility issues originating from the logging
    framework](https://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#no_tlm).

### Notable changes in 3.1.0 {#upgrade_310_notable}

-   Apache Kafka supports Java 17.
-   The following metrics have been deprecated:
    `bufferpool-wait-time-total`, `io-waittime-total`, and
    `iotime-total`. Please use `bufferpool-wait-time-ns-total`,
    `io-wait-time-ns-total`, and `io-time-ns-total` instead. See
    [KIP-773](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-773%3A+Differentiate+consistently+metric+latency+measured+in+millis+and+nanos)

-   IBP 3.1 introduces topic IDs to FetchRequest as a part of
    [KIP-516](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-516%3A+Topic+Identifiers).

## Upgrading to 3.0.1 from any version 0.8.x through 2.8.x {#upgrade_3_0_1}

    [KAFKA-13598](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13598) for
    more details. This issue was fixed and the default is properly
    applied.

### Notable changes in 3.0.0 {#upgrade_300_notable}

-   The producer has stronger delivery guarantees by default:
    `idempotence` is enabled and `acks` is set to `all` instead of `1`.
    See
    [KIP-679](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-679%3A+Producer+will+enable+the+strongest+delivery+guarantee+by+default)

    [KAFKA-13598](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13598) for
    more details. This issue was fixed and the default is properly
    applied in 3.0.1, 3.1.1, and 3.2.0.

-   Java 8 and Scala 2.12 support have been deprecated since Apache
    Kafka 3.0 and will be removed in Apache Kafka 4.0. See
    [KIP-750](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=181308223)

    for more details.

-   ZooKeeper has been upgraded to version 3.6.3.

-   A preview of KRaft mode is available, though upgrading to it from
    the 2.8 Early Access release is not possible. See the
    `config/kraft/README.md` file for details.

-   The release tarball no longer includes test, sources, javadoc and
    test sources jars. These are still published to the Maven Central
    repository.

-   A number of implementation dependency jars are [now available in the runtime classpath instead of compile and runtime classpaths](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10203). Compilation
    errors after the upgrade can be fixed by adding the missing
    dependency jar(s) explicitly or updating the application not to use
    internal classes.

-   The default value for the consumer configuration
    `session.timeout.ms` was increased from 10s to 45s. See
    [KIP-735](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-735%3A+Increase+default+consumer+session+timeout)
    for more details.

-   The broker configuration `log.message.format.version` and topic
    configuration `message.format.version` have been deprecated. The
    value of both configurations is always assumed to be `3.0` if
    `inter.broker.protocol.version` is `3.0` or higher. If
    `log.message.format.version` or `message.format.version` are set, we
    recommend clearing them at the same time as the
    `inter.broker.protocol.version` upgrade to 3.0. This will avoid
    potential compatibility issues if the
    `inter.broker.protocol.version` is downgraded. See
    [KIP-724](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-724%3A+Drop+support+for+message+formats+v0+and+v1)
    for more details.

-   The Streams API removed all deprecated APIs that were deprecated in
    version 2.5.0 or earlier. For a complete list of removed APIs
    compare the detailed Kafka Streams upgrade notes.

-   Kafka Streams no longer has a compile time dependency on
    \"connect:json\" module
    ([KAFKA-5146](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-5146)).
    Projects that were relying on this transitive dependency will have
    to explicitly declare it.

-   Custom principal builder implementations specified through
    `principal.builder.class` must now implement the
    `KafkaPrincipalSerde` interface to allow for forwarding between
    brokers. See
    [KIP-590](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-590%3A+Redirect+Zookeeper+Mutation+Protocols+to+The+Controller)
    for more details about the usage of KafkaPrincipalSerde.

-   A number of deprecated classes, methods and tools have been removed
    from the `clients`, `connect`, `core` and `tools` modules:

    -   The Scala `Authorizer`, `SimpleAclAuthorizer` and related
        classes have been removed. Please use the Java `Authorizer` and
        `AclAuthorizer` instead.
    -   The `Metric#value()` method was removed
        ([KAFKA-12573](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12573)).
    -   The `Sum` and `Total` classes were removed
        ([KAFKA-12584](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12584)).
        Please use `WindowedSum` and `CumulativeSum` instead.
    -   The `Count` and `SampledTotal` classes were removed. Please use
        `WindowedCount` and `WindowedSum` respectively instead.
    -   The `PrincipalBuilder`, `DefaultPrincipalBuilder` and
        `ResourceFilter` classes were removed.
    -   Various constants and constructors were removed from
        `SslConfigs`, `SaslConfigs`, `AclBinding` and
        `AclBindingFilter`.
    -   The `Admin.electedPreferredLeaders()` methods were removed.
        Please use `Admin.electLeaders` instead.
    -   The `kafka-preferred-replica-election` command line tool was
        removed. Please use `kafka-leader-election` instead.
    -   The `--zookeeper` option was removed from the `kafka-topics` and
        `kafka-reassign-partitions` command line tools. Please use
        `--bootstrap-server` instead.
    -   In the `kafka-configs` command line tool, the `--zookeeper`
        option is only supported for updating [SCRAM Credentials
        configuration](../security#security_sasl_scram_credentials) and
        [describing/updating dynamic broker configs when brokers are not
        running](../configuration#dynamicbrokerconfigs). Please use `--bootstrap-server`
        for other configuration operations.
    -   The `ConfigEntry` constructor was removed
        ([KAFKA-12577](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12577)).
        Please use the remaining public constructor instead.
    -   The config value `default` for the client config
        `client.dns.lookup` has been removed. In the unlikely event that
        you set this config explicitly, we recommend leaving the config
        unset (`use_all_dns_ips` is used by default).
    -   The `ExtendedDeserializer` and `ExtendedSerializer` classes have
        been removed. Please use `Deserializer` and `Serializer`
        instead.
    -   The `close(long, TimeUnit)` method was removed from the
        producer, consumer and admin client. Please use
        `close(Duration)`.
    -   The `ConsumerConfig.addDeserializerToConfig` and
        `ProducerConfig.addSerializerToConfig` methods were removed.
        These methods were not intended to be public API and there is no
        replacement.
    -   The `NoOffsetForPartitionException.partition()` method was
        removed. Please use `partitions()` instead.
    -   The default `partition.assignment.strategy` is changed to
        \"\[RangeAssignor, CooperativeStickyAssignor\]\", which will use
        the RangeAssignor by default, but allows upgrading to the
        CooperativeStickyAssignor with just a single rolling bounce that
        removes the RangeAssignor from the list. Please check the client
        upgrade path guide
        [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-429:+Kafka+Consumer+Incremental+Rebalance+Protocol#KIP429:KafkaConsumerIncrementalRebalanceProtocol-Consumer)
        for more detail.
    -   The Scala `kafka.common.MessageFormatter` was removed. Please
        use the Java `org.apache.kafka.common.MessageFormatter`.
    -   The `MessageFormatter.init(Properties)` method was removed.
        Please use `configure(Map)` instead.
    -   The `checksum()` method has been removed from `ConsumerRecord`
        and `RecordMetadata`. The message format v2, which has been the
        default since 0.11, moved the checksum from the record to the
        record batch. As such, these methods don\'t make sense and no
        replacements exist.
    -   The `ChecksumMessageFormatter` class was removed. It is not part
        of the public API, but it may have been used with
        `kafka-console-consumer.sh`. It reported the checksum of each
        record, which has not been supported since message format v2.
    -   The
        `org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.internals.PartitionAssignor`
        class has been removed. Please use
        `org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerPartitionAssignor`
        instead.
    -   The `quota.producer.default` and `quota.consumer.default`
        configurations were removed
        ([KAFKA-12591](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12591)).
        Dynamic quota defaults must be used instead.
    -   The `port` and `host.name` configurations were removed. Please
        use `listeners` instead.
    -   The `advertised.port` and `advertised.host.name` configurations
        were removed. Please use `advertised.listeners` instead.
    -   The deprecated worker configurations `rest.host.name` and
        `rest.port` were removed
        ([KAFKA-12482](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12482))
        from the Kafka Connect worker configuration. Please use
        `listeners` instead.

-   The
    `Producer#sendOffsetsToTransaction(Map offsets, String consumerGroupId)`
    method has been deprecated. Please use
    `Producer#sendOffsetsToTransaction(Map offsets, ConsumerGroupMetadata metadata)`
    instead, where the `ConsumerGroupMetadata` can be retrieved via
    `KafkaConsumer#groupMetadata()` for stronger semantics. Note that
    the full set of consumer group metadata is only understood by
    brokers or version 2.5 or higher, so you must upgrade your kafka
    cluster to get the stronger semantics. Otherwise, you can just pass
    in `new ConsumerGroupMetadata(consumerGroupId)` to work with older
    brokers. See [KIP-732](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/zJONCg)
    for more details.

-   The Connect `internal.key.converter` and `internal.value.converter`
    properties have been completely
    [removed](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/2YDOCg). The use of
    these Connect worker properties has been deprecated since version
    2.0.0. Workers are now hardcoded to use the JSON converter with
    `schemas.enable` set to `false`. If your cluster has been using a
    different internal key or value converter, you can follow the
    migration steps outlined in
    [KIP-738](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/2YDOCg) to safely
    upgrade your Connect cluster to 3.0.

-   The Connect-based MirrorMaker (MM2) includes changes to support
    `IdentityReplicationPolicy`, enabling replication without renaming
    topics. The existing `DefaultReplicationPolicy` is still used by
    default, but identity replication can be enabled via the
    `replication.policy` configuration property. This is especially
    useful for users migrating from the older MirrorMaker (MM1), or for
    use-cases with simple one-way replication topologies where topic
    renaming is undesirable. Note that `IdentityReplicationPolicy`,
    unlike `DefaultReplicationPolicy`, cannot prevent replication cycles
    based on topic names, so take care to avoid cycles when constructing
    your replication topology.

-   The original MirrorMaker (MM1) and related classes have been
    deprecated. Please use the Connect-based MirrorMaker (MM2), as
    described in the [Geo-Replication section](../operations#georeplication).

## Upgrading to 2.8.1 from any version 0.8.x through 2.7.x {#upgrade_2_8_1}

**If you are upgrading from a version prior to 2.1.x, please see the
note below about the change to the schema used to store consumer
offsets. Once you have changed the inter.broker.protocol.version to the
latest version, it will not be possible to downgrade to a version prior
to 2.1.**

**For a rolling upgrade:**

1.  Update server.properties on all brokers and add the following
    properties. CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION refers to the version you are
    upgrading from. CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION refers to the message
    format version currently in use. If you have previously overridden
    the message format version, you should keep its current value.
    Alternatively, if you are upgrading from a version prior to
    0.11.0.x, then CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION should be set to match
    CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. `2.7`,
        `2.6`, etc.)
    -   log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See
        [potential performance impact following the upgrade](#upgrade_10_performance_impact) for the details on what
        this configuration does.)

    If you are upgrading from version 0.11.0.x or above, and you have
    not overridden the message format, then you only need to override
    the inter-broker protocol version.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. `2.7`,
        `2.6`, etc.)
2.  Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the
    code, and restart it. Once you have done so, the brokers will be
    running the latest version and you can verify that the cluster\'s
    behavior and performance meets expectations. It is still possible to
    downgrade at this point if there are any problems.
3.  Once the cluster\'s behavior and performance has been verified, bump
    the protocol version by editing `inter.broker.protocol.version` and
    setting it to `2.8`.
4.  Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take
    effect. Once the brokers begin using the latest protocol version, it
    will no longer be possible to downgrade the cluster to an older
    version.
5.  If you have overridden the message format version as instructed
    above, then you need to do one more rolling restart to upgrade it to
    its latest version. Once all (or most) consumers have been upgraded
    to 0.11.0 or later, change log.message.format.version to 2.8 on each
    broker and restart them one by one. Note that the older Scala
    clients, which are no longer maintained, do not support the message
    format introduced in 0.11, so to avoid conversion costs (or to take
    advantage of [exactly once semantics](#upgrade_11_exactly_once_semantics)), the newer Java
    clients must be used.

### Notable changes in 2.8.0 {#upgrade_280_notable}

-   The 2.8.0 release added a new method to the Authorizer Interface
    introduced in
    [KIP-679](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-679%3A+Producer+will+enable+the+strongest+delivery+guarantee+by+default).
    The motivation is to unblock our future plan to enable the strongest
    message delivery guarantee by default. Custom authorizer should
    consider providing a more efficient implementation that supports
    audit logging and any custom configs or access rules.
-   IBP 2.8 introduces topic IDs to topics as a part of
    [KIP-516](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-516%3A+Topic+Identifiers).
    When using ZooKeeper, this information is stored in the TopicZNode.
    If the cluster is downgraded to a previous IBP or version, future
    topics will not get topic IDs and it is not guaranteed that topics
    will retain their topic IDs in ZooKeeper. This means that upon
    upgrading again, some topics or all topics will be assigned new IDs.
-   Kafka Streams introduce a type-safe `split()` operator as a
    substitution for deprecated `KStream#branch()` method (cf.
    [KIP-418](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-418%3A+A+method-chaining+way+to+branch+KStream)).

## Upgrading to 2.7.0 from any version 0.8.x through 2.6.x {#upgrade_2_7_0}

**If you are upgrading from a version prior to 2.1.x, please see the
note below about the change to the schema used to store consumer
offsets. Once you have changed the inter.broker.protocol.version to the
latest version, it will not be possible to downgrade to a version prior
to 2.1.**

    the message format version, you should keep its current value.
    Alternatively, if you are upgrading from a version prior to
    0.11.0.x, then CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION should be set to match
    CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. `2.6`,
        `2.5`, etc.)
    -   log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See
        [potential performance impact following the upgrade](#upgrade_10_performance_impact) for the details on what
        this configuration does.)

    If you are upgrading from version 0.11.0.x or above, and you have
    not overridden the message format, then you only need to override
    the inter-broker protocol version.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. `2.6`,

    format introduced in 0.11, so to avoid conversion costs (or to take
    advantage of [exactly once semantics](#upgrade_11_exactly_once_semantics)), the newer Java
    clients must be used.

### Notable changes in 2.7.0 {#upgrade_270_notable}

-   The 2.7.0 release includes the core Raft implementation specified in
    [KIP-595](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-595%3A+A+Raft+Protocol+for+the+Metadata+Quorum).
    There is a separate \"raft\" module containing most of the logic.
    Until integration with the controller is complete, there is a
    standalone server that users can use for testing the performance of
    the Raft implementation. See the README.md in the raft module for
    details
-   KIP-651 [adds
    support](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-651+-+Support+PEM+format+for+SSL+certificates+and+private+key)
    for using PEM files for key and trust stores.
-   KIP-612 [adds
    support](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-612%3A+Ability+to+Limit+Connection+Creation+Rate+on+Brokers)
    for enforcing broker-wide and per-listener connection create rates.
    The 2.7.0 release contains the first part of KIP-612 with dynamic
    configuration coming in the 2.8.0 release.
-   The ability to throttle topic and partition creations or topics
    deletions to prevent a cluster from being harmed via
    [KIP-599](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-599%3A+Throttle+Create+Topic%2C+Create+Partition+and+Delete+Topic+Operations)
-   When new features become available in Kafka there are two main
    issues:
    1.  How do Kafka clients become aware of broker capabilities?
    2.  How does the broker decide which features to enable?

    [KIP-584](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-584%3A+Versioning+scheme+for+features)
    provides a flexible and operationally easy solution for client
    discovery, feature gating and rolling upgrades using a single
    restart.
-   The ability to print record offsets and headers with the
    `ConsoleConsumer` is now possible via
    [KIP-431](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-431%3A+Support+of+printing+additional+ConsumerRecord+fields+in+DefaultMessageFormatter)
-   The addition of
    [KIP-554](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-554%3A+Add+Broker-side+SCRAM+Config+API)
    continues progress towards the goal of Zookeeper removal from Kafka.
    The addition of KIP-554 means you don\'t have to connect directly to
    ZooKeeper anymore for managing SCRAM credentials.
-   Altering non-reconfigurable configs of existent listeners causes
    `InvalidRequestException`. By contrast, the previous (unintended)
    behavior would have caused the updated configuration to be
    persisted, but it wouldn\'t take effect until the broker was
    restarted. See
    [KAFKA-10479](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9284) for more
    discussion. See `DynamicBrokerConfig.DynamicSecurityConfigs` and
    `SocketServer.ListenerReconfigurableConfigs` for the supported
    reconfigurable configs of existent listeners.
-   Kafka Streams adds support for [Sliding Windows
    Aggregations](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-450%3A+Sliding+Window+Aggregations+in+the+DSL)
    in the KStreams DSL.

## Upgrading to 2.6.0 from any version 0.8.x through 2.5.x {#upgrade_2_6_0}

**If you are upgrading from a version prior to 2.1.x, please see the
note below about the change to the schema used to store consumer
offsets. Once you have changed the inter.broker.protocol.version to the
latest version, it will not be possible to downgrade to a version prior
to 2.1.**

**For a rolling upgrade:**

1.  Update server.properties on all brokers and add the following
    properties. CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION refers to the version you are
    upgrading from. CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION refers to the message
    format version currently in use. If you have previously overridden
    the message format version, you should keep its current value.
    Alternatively, if you are upgrading from a version prior to
    0.11.0.x, then CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION should be set to match
    CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. `2.5`,
        `2.4`, etc.)
    -   log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See
        [potential performance impact following the upgrade](#upgrade_10_performance_impact) for the details on what
        this configuration does.)

    If you are upgrading from version 0.11.0.x or above, and you have
    not overridden the message format, then you only need to override
    the inter-broker protocol version.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. `2.5`,
        `2.4`, etc.)
2.  Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the
    code, and restart it. Once you have done so, the brokers will be
    running the latest version and you can verify that the cluster\'s
    behavior and performance meets expectations. It is still possible to
    downgrade at this point if there are any problems.
3.  Once the cluster\'s behavior and performance has been verified, bump
    the protocol version by editing `inter.broker.protocol.version` and
    setting it to `2.6`.
4.  Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take
    effect. Once the brokers begin using the latest protocol version, it
    will no longer be possible to downgrade the cluster to an older
    version.
5.  If you have overridden the message format version as instructed
    above, then you need to do one more rolling restart to upgrade it to
    its latest version. Once all (or most) consumers have been upgraded
    to 0.11.0 or later, change log.message.format.version to 2.6 on each
    broker and restart them one by one. Note that the older Scala
    clients, which are no longer maintained, do not support the message
    format introduced in 0.11, so to avoid conversion costs (or to take
    advantage of [exactly once semantics](#upgrade_11_exactly_once_semantics)), the newer Java
    clients must be used.

### Notable changes in 2.6.0 {#upgrade_260_notable .anchor-link}

-   Kafka Streams adds a new processing mode (requires broker 2.5 or
    newer) that improves application scalability using exactly-once
    guarantees (cf.
    [KIP-447](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-447%3A+Producer+scalability+for+exactly+once+semantics))
-   TLSv1.3 has been enabled by default for Java 11 or newer. The client
    and server will negotiate TLSv1.3 if both support it and fallback to
    TLSv1.2 otherwise. See
    [KIP-573](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-573%3A+Enable+TLSv1.3+by+default)
    for more details.
-   The default value for the `client.dns.lookup` configuration has been
    changed from `default` to `use_all_dns_ips`. If a hostname resolves
    to multiple IP addresses, clients and brokers will now attempt to
    connect to each IP in sequence until the connection is successfully
    established. See
    [KIP-602](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-602%3A+Change+default+value+for+client.dns.lookup)
    for more details.
-   `NotLeaderForPartitionException` has been deprecated and replaced
    with `NotLeaderOrFollowerException`. Fetch requests and other
    requests intended only for the leader or follower return
    NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER(6) instead of REPLICA_NOT_AVAILABLE(9) if the
    broker is not a replica, ensuring that this transient error during
    reassignments is handled by all clients as a retriable exception.

## Upgrading to 2.5.0 from any version 0.8.x through 2.4.x {#upgrade_2_5_0}

**If you are upgrading from a version prior to 2.1.x, please see the
note below about the change to the schema used to store consumer
offsets. Once you have changed the inter.broker.protocol.version to the
latest version, it will not be possible to downgrade to a version prior
to 2.1.**

**For a rolling upgrade:**

1.  Update server.properties on all brokers and add the following
    properties. CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION refers to the version you are
    upgrading from. CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION refers to the message
    format version currently in use. If you have previously overridden
    the message format version, you should keep its current value.
    Alternatively, if you are upgrading from a version prior to
    0.11.0.x, then CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION should be set to match
    CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. `2.4`,
        `2.3`, etc.)
    -   log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See
        [potential performance impact following the upgrade](#upgrade_10_performance_impact) for the details on what
        this configuration does.)

    If you are upgrading from version 0.11.0.x or above, and you have
    not overridden the message format, then you only need to override
    the inter-broker protocol version.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. `2.4`,
        `2.3`, etc.)
2.  Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the
    code, and restart it. Once you have done so, the brokers will be
    running the latest version and you can verify that the cluster\'s
    behavior and performance meets expectations. It is still possible to
    downgrade at this point if there are any problems.
3.  Once the cluster\'s behavior and performance has been verified, bump
    the protocol version by editing `inter.broker.protocol.version` and
    setting it to `2.5`.
4.  Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take
    effect. Once the brokers begin using the latest protocol version, it
    will no longer be possible to downgrade the cluster to an older
    version.
5.  If you have overridden the message format version as instructed
    above, then you need to do one more rolling restart to upgrade it to
    its latest version. Once all (or most) consumers have been upgraded
    to 0.11.0 or later, change log.message.format.version to 2.5 on each
    broker and restart them one by one. Note that the older Scala
    clients, which are no longer maintained, do not support the message
    format introduced in 0.11, so to avoid conversion costs (or to take
    advantage of [exactly once semantics](#upgrade_11_exactly_once_semantics)), the newer Java
    clients must be used.
6.  There are several notable changes to the reassignment tool
    `kafka-reassign-partitions.sh` following the completion of
    [KIP-455](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-455%3A+Create+an+Administrative+API+for+Replica+Reassignment).
    This tool now requires the `--additional` flag to be provided when
    changing the throttle of an active reassignment. Reassignment
    cancellation is now possible using the `--cancel` command. Finally,
    reassignment with `--zookeeper` has been deprecated in favor of
    `--bootstrap-server`. See the KIP for more detail.

### Notable changes in 2.5.0 {#upgrade_250_notable .anchor-link}

-   When `RebalanceProtocol#COOPERATIVE` is used, `Consumer#poll` can
    still return data while it is in the middle of a rebalance for those
    partitions still owned by the consumer; in addition
    `Consumer#commitSync` now may throw a non-fatal
    `RebalanceInProgressException` to notify users of such an event, in
    order to distinguish from the fatal `CommitFailedException` and
    allow users to complete the ongoing rebalance and then reattempt
    committing offsets for those still-owned partitions.
-   For improved resiliency in typical network environments, the default
    value of `zookeeper.session.timeout.ms` has been increased from 6s
    to 18s and `replica.lag.time.max.ms` from 10s to 30s.
-   New DSL operator `cogroup()` has been added for aggregating multiple
    streams together at once.
-   Added a new `KStream.toTable()` API to translate an input event
    stream into a KTable.
-   Added a new Serde type `Void` to represent null keys or null values
    from input topic.
-   Deprecated `UsePreviousTimeOnInvalidTimestamp` and replaced it with
    `UsePartitionTimeOnInvalidTimeStamp`.
-   Improved exactly-once semantics by adding a pending offset fencing
    mechanism and stronger transactional commit consistency check, which
    greatly simplifies the implementation of a scalable exactly-once
    application. We also added a new exactly-once semantics code example
    under [examples](https://github.com/apache/kafka/tree/2.5/examples)
    folder. Check out
    [KIP-447](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-447%3A+Producer+scalability+for+exactly+once+semantics)
    for the full details.
-   Added a new public api
    `KafkaStreams.queryMetadataForKey(String, K, Serializer) to get detailed information on the key being queried. It provides information about the partition number where the key resides in addition to hosts containing the active and standby partitions for the key.`
-   Provided support to query stale stores (for high availability) and
    the stores belonging to a specific partition by deprecating
    `KafkaStreams.store(String, QueryableStoreType)` and replacing it
    with `KafkaStreams.store(StoreQueryParameters)`.
-   Added a new public api to access lag information for stores local to
    an instance with `KafkaStreams.allLocalStorePartitionLags()`.
-   Scala 2.11 is no longer supported. See
    [KIP-531](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-531%3A+Drop+support+for+Scala+2.11+in+Kafka+2.5)
    for details.
-   All Scala classes from the package `kafka.security.auth` have been
    deprecated. See
    [KIP-504](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-504+-+Add+new+Java+Authorizer+Interface)
    for details of the new Java authorizer API added in 2.4.0. Note that
    `kafka.security.auth.Authorizer` and
    `kafka.security.auth.SimpleAclAuthorizer` were deprecated in 2.4.0.
-   TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 have been disabled by default since these have
    known security vulnerabilities. Only TLSv1.2 is now enabled by
    default. You can continue to use TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 by explicitly
    enabling these in the configuration options `ssl.protocol` and
    `ssl.enabled.protocols`.
-   ZooKeeper has been upgraded to 3.5.7, and a ZooKeeper upgrade from
    3.4.X to 3.5.7 can fail if there are no snapshot files in the 3.4
    data directory. This usually happens in test upgrades where
    ZooKeeper 3.5.7 is trying to load an existing 3.4 data dir in which
    no snapshot file has been created. For more details about the issue
    please refer to
    [ZOOKEEPER-3056](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-3056).
    A fix is given in
    [ZOOKEEPER-3056](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-3056),
    which is to set `snapshot.trust.empty=true` config in
    `zookeeper.properties` before the upgrade.
-   ZooKeeper version 3.5.7 supports TLS-encrypted connectivity to
    ZooKeeper both with or without client certificates, and additional
    Kafka configurations are available to take advantage of this. See
    [KIP-515](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-515%3A+Enable+ZK+client+to+use+the+new+TLS+supported+authentication)
    for details.

## Upgrading from 0.8.x, 0.9.x, 0.10.0.x, 0.10.1.x, 0.10.2.x, 0.11.0.x, 1.0.x, 1.1.x, 2.0.x or 2.1.x or 2.2.x or 2.3.x to 2.4.0 {#upgrade_2_4_0}

    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g.
        0.10.0, 0.11.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.2).
    -   log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See
        [potential performance impact following the upgrade](#upgrade_10_performance_impact) for the details on what
        this configuration does.)

    If you are upgrading from version 0.11.0.x or above, and you have
    not overridden the message format, then you only need to override
    the inter-broker protocol version.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (0.11.0,
        1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3).
2.  Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the
    code, and restart it. Once you have done so, the brokers will be
    running the latest version and you can verify that the cluster\'s
    behavior and performance meets expectations. It is still possible to
    downgrade at this point if there are any problems.
3.  Once the cluster\'s behavior and performance has been verified, bump
    the protocol version by editing `inter.broker.protocol.version` and
    setting it to 2.4.
4.  Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take

    will no longer be possible to downgrade the cluster to an older
    version.
5.  If you have overridden the message format version as instructed

    format introduced in 0.11, so to avoid conversion costs (or to take
    advantage of [exactly once semantics](#upgrade_11_exactly_once_semantics)), the newer Java
    clients must be used.

**Additional Upgrade Notes:**

1.  ZooKeeper has been upgraded to 3.5.6. ZooKeeper upgrade from 3.4.X
    to 3.5.6 can fail if there are no snapshot files in 3.4 data
    directory. This usually happens in test upgrades where ZooKeeper
    3.5.6 is trying to load an existing 3.4 data dir in which no
    snapshot file has been created. For more details about the issue
    please refer to
    [ZOOKEEPER-3056](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-3056).
    A fix is given in
    [ZOOKEEPER-3056](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-3056),
    which is to set `snapshot.trust.empty=true` config in
    `zookeeper.properties` before the upgrade. But we have observed data
    loss in standalone cluster upgrades when using
    `snapshot.trust.empty=true` config. For more details about the issue
    please refer to
    [ZOOKEEPER-3644](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-3644).
    So we recommend the safe workaround of copying empty
    [snapshot](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12928686/snapshot.0)
    file to the 3.4 data directory, if there are no snapshot files in
    3.4 data directory. For more details about the workaround please
    refer to [ZooKeeper Upgrade
    FAQ](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/Upgrade+FAQ).
2.  An embedded Jetty based
    [AdminServer](http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.5.6/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_adminserver)
    added in ZooKeeper 3.5. AdminServer is enabled by default in
    ZooKeeper and is started on port 8080. AdminServer is disabled by
    default in the ZooKeeper config (`zookeeper.properties`) provided by
    the Apache Kafka distribution. Make sure to update your local
    `zookeeper.properties` file with `admin.enableServer=false` if you
    wish to disable the AdminServer. Please refer [AdminServer
    config](http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.5.6/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_adminserver)
    to configure the AdminServer.

### Notable changes in 2.4.0 {#upgrade_240_notable}

-   A new Admin API has been added for partition reassignments. Due to
    changing the way Kafka propagates reassignment information, it is
    possible to lose reassignment state in failure edge cases while
    upgrading to the new version. It is not recommended to start
    reassignments while upgrading.
-   ZooKeeper has been upgraded from 3.4.14 to 3.5.6. TLS and dynamic
    reconfiguration are supported by the new version.
-   The `bin/kafka-preferred-replica-election.sh` command line tool has
    been deprecated. It has been replaced by
    `bin/kafka-leader-election.sh`.
-   The methods `electPreferredLeaders` in the Java `AdminClient` class
    have been deprecated in favor of the methods `electLeaders`.
-   Scala code leveraging the `NewTopic(String, int, short)` constructor
    with literal values will need to explicitly call `toShort` on the
    second literal.
-   The argument in the constructor
    `GroupAuthorizationException(String)` is now used to specify an
    exception message. Previously it referred to the group that failed
    authorization. This was done for consistency with other exception
    types and to avoid potential misuse. The constructor
    `TopicAuthorizationException(String)` which was previously used for
    a single unauthorized topic was changed similarly.
-   The internal `PartitionAssignor` interface has been deprecated and
    replaced with a new `ConsumerPartitionAssignor` in the public API.
    Some methods/signatures are slightly different between the two
    interfaces. Users implementing a custom PartitionAssignor should
    migrate to the new interface as soon as possible.
-   The `DefaultPartitioner` now uses a sticky partitioning strategy.
    This means that records for specific topic with null keys and no
    assigned partition will be sent to the same partition until the
    batch is ready to be sent. When a new batch is created, a new
    partition is chosen. This decreases latency to produce, but it may
    result in uneven distribution of records across partitions in edge
    cases. Generally users will not be impacted, but this difference may
    be noticeable in tests and other situations producing records for a
    very short amount of time.
-   The blocking `KafkaConsumer#committed` methods have been extended to
    allow a list of partitions as input parameters rather than a single
    partition. It enables fewer request/response iterations between
    clients and brokers fetching for the committed offsets for the
    consumer group. The old overloaded functions are deprecated and we
    would recommend users to make their code changes to leverage the new
    methods (details can be found in
    [KIP-520](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-520%3A+Add+overloaded+Consumer%23committed+for+batching+partitions)).
-   We\'ve introduced a new `INVALID_RECORD` error in the produce
    response to distinguish from the `CORRUPT_MESSAGE` error. To be more
    concrete, previously when a batch of records was sent as part of a
    single request to the broker and one or more of the records failed
    the validation due to various causes (mismatch magic bytes, crc
    checksum errors, null key for log compacted topics, etc), the whole
    batch would be rejected with the same and misleading
    `CORRUPT_MESSAGE`, and the caller of the producer client would see
    the corresponding exception from either the future object of
    `RecordMetadata` returned from the `send` call as well as in the
    `Callback#onCompletion(RecordMetadata metadata, Exception exception)`
    Now with the new error code and improved error messages of the
    exception, producer callers would be better informed about the root
    cause why their sent records were failed.
-   We are introducing incremental cooperative rebalancing to the
    clients\' group protocol, which allows consumers to keep all of
    their assigned partitions during a rebalance and at the end revoke
    only those which must be migrated to another consumer for overall
    cluster balance. The `ConsumerCoordinator` will choose the latest
    `RebalanceProtocol` that is commonly supported by all of the
    consumer\'s supported assignors. You can use the new built-in
    `CooperativeStickyAssignor` or plug in your own custom cooperative
    assignor. To do so you must implement the
    `ConsumerPartitionAssignor` interface and include
    `RebalanceProtocol.COOPERATIVE` in the list returned by
    `ConsumerPartitionAssignor#supportedProtocols`. Your custom assignor
    can then leverage the `ownedPartitions` field in each consumer\'s
    `Subscription` to give partitions back to their previous owners
    whenever possible. Note that when a partition is to be reassigned to
    another consumer, it *must* be removed from the new assignment until
    it has been revoked from its original owner. Any consumer that has
    to revoke a partition will trigger a followup rebalance to allow the
    revoked partition to safely be assigned to its new owner. See the
    [ConsumerPartitionAssignor RebalanceProtocol
    javadocs](https://kafka.apache.org/24/javadoc/index.html?org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/ConsumerPartitionAssignor.RebalanceProtocol.html)
    for more information.\
    To upgrade from the old (eager) protocol, which always revokes all
    partitions before rebalancing, to cooperative rebalancing, you must
    follow a specific upgrade path to get all clients on the same
    `ConsumerPartitionAssignor` that supports the cooperative protocol.
    This can be done with two rolling bounces, using the
    `CooperativeStickyAssignor` for the example: during the first one,
    add \"cooperative-sticky\" to the list of supported assignors for
    each member (without removing the previous assignor \-- note that if
    previously using the default, you must include that explicitly as
    well). You then bounce and/or upgrade it. Once the entire group is
    on 2.4+ and all members have the \"cooperative-sticky\" among their
    supported assignors, remove the other assignor(s) and perform a
    second rolling bounce so that by the end all members support only
    the cooperative protocol. For further details on the cooperative
    rebalancing protocol and upgrade path, see
    [KIP-429](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/vAclBg).
-   There are some behavioral changes to the
    `ConsumerRebalanceListener`, as well as a new API. Exceptions thrown
    during any of the listener\'s three callbacks will no longer be
    swallowed, and will instead be re-thrown all the way up to the
    `Consumer.poll()` call. The `onPartitionsLost` method has been added
    to allow users to react to abnormal circumstances where a consumer
    may have lost ownership of its partitions (such as a missed
    rebalance) and cannot commit offsets. By default, this will simply
    call the existing `onPartitionsRevoked` API to align with previous
    behavior. Note however that `onPartitionsLost` will not be called
    when the set of lost partitions is empty. This means that no
    callback will be invoked at the beginning of the first rebalance of
    a new consumer joining the group.\
    The semantics of the `ConsumerRebalanceListener's` callbacks are
    further changed when following the cooperative rebalancing protocol
    described above. In addition to `onPartitionsLost`,
    `onPartitionsRevoked` will also never be called when the set of
    revoked partitions is empty. The callback will generally be invoked
    only at the end of a rebalance, and only on the set of partitions
    that are being moved to another consumer. The `onPartitionsAssigned`
    callback will however always be called, even with an empty set of
    partitions, as a way to notify users of a rebalance event (this is
    true for both cooperative and eager). For details on the new
    callback semantics, see the [ConsumerRebalanceListener
    javadocs](https://kafka.apache.org/24/javadoc/index.html?org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/ConsumerRebalanceListener.html).
-   The Scala trait `kafka.security.auth.Authorizer` has been deprecated
    and replaced with a new Java API
    `org.apache.kafka.server.authorizer.Authorizer`. The authorizer
    implementation class `kafka.security.auth.SimpleAclAuthorizer` has
    also been deprecated and replaced with a new implementation
    `kafka.security.authorizer.AclAuthorizer`. `AclAuthorizer` uses
    features supported by the new API to improve authorization logging
    and is compatible with `SimpleAclAuthorizer`. For more details, see
    [KIP-504](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-504+-+Add+new+Java+Authorizer+Interface).

## Upgrading from 0.8.x, 0.9.x, 0.10.0.x, 0.10.1.x, 0.10.2.x, 0.11.0.x, 1.0.x, 1.1.x, 2.0.x or 2.1.x or 2.2.x to 2.3.0 {#upgrade_2_3_0}

**If you are upgrading from a version prior to 2.1.x, please see the
note below about the change to the schema used to store consumer
offsets. Once you have changed the inter.broker.protocol.version to the
latest version, it will not be possible to downgrade to a version prior
to 2.1.**

    the message format version, you should keep its current value.
    Alternatively, if you are upgrading from a version prior to
    0.11.0.x, then CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION should be set to match
    CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. 0.8.2,
        0.9.0, 0.10.0, 0.10.1, 0.10.2, 0.11.0, 1.0, 1.1).
    -   log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See
        [potential performance impact following the upgrade](#upgrade_10_performance_impact) for the details on what
        this configuration does.)

    If you are upgrading from 0.11.0.x, 1.0.x, 1.1.x, 2.0.x, or 2.1.x,
    and you have not overridden the message format, then you only need
    to override the inter-broker protocol version.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (0.11.0,
        1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2).
2.  Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the
    code, and restart it. Once you have done so, the brokers will be
    running the latest version and you can verify that the cluster\'s
    behavior and performance meets expectations. It is still possible to
    downgrade at this point if there are any problems.
3.  Once the cluster\'s behavior and performance has been verified, bump
    the protocol version by editing `inter.broker.protocol.version` and
    setting it to 2.3.
4.  Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take

5.  If you have overridden the message format version as instructed
    above, then you need to do one more rolling restart to upgrade it to
    its latest version. Once all (or most) consumers have been upgraded
    to 0.11.0 or later, change log.message.format.version to 2.3 on each
    broker and restart them one by one. Note that the older Scala
    clients, which are no longer maintained, do not support the message
    format introduced in 0.11, so to avoid conversion costs (or to take
    advantage of [exactly once semantics](#upgrade_11_exactly_once_semantics)), the newer Java
    clients must be used.

### Notable changes in 2.3.0 {#upgrade_230_notable}

-   We are introducing a new rebalancing protocol for Kafka Connect
    based on [incremental cooperative rebalancing](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-415%3A+Incremental+Cooperative+Rebalancing+in+Kafka+Connect).
    The new protocol does not require stopping all the tasks during a
    rebalancing phase between Connect workers. Instead, only the tasks
    that need to be exchanged between workers are stopped and they are
    started in a follow up rebalance. The new Connect protocol is
    enabled by default beginning with 2.3.0. For more details on how it
    works and how to enable the old behavior of eager rebalancing,
    checkout [incremental cooperative rebalancing
    design](/{{< param akVersion >}}../connect_administration).
-   We are introducing static membership towards consumer user. This
    feature reduces unnecessary rebalances during normal application
    upgrades or rolling bounces. For more details on how to use it,
    checkout [static membership
    design](/{{< param akVersion >}}/documentation/#static_membership).
-   Kafka Streams DSL switches its used store types. While this change
    is mainly transparent to users, there are some corner cases that may
    require code changes. See the [Kafka Streams upgrade section](../streams/upgrade-guide#streams_api_changes_230)
    for more details.
-   Kafka Streams 2.3.0 requires 0.11 message format or higher and does
    not work with older message format.

## Upgrading from 0.8.x, 0.9.x, 0.10.0.x, 0.10.1.x, 0.10.2.x, 0.11.0.x, 1.0.x, 1.1.x, 2.0.x or 2.1.x to 2.2.0 {#upgrade_2_2_0}

**If you are upgrading from a version prior to 2.1.x, please see the
note below about the change to the schema used to store consumer
offsets. Once you have changed the inter.broker.protocol.version to the
latest version, it will not be possible to downgrade to a version prior
to 2.1.**

**For a rolling upgrade:**

1.  Update server.properties on all brokers and add the following
    properties. CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION refers to the version you are
    upgrading from. CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION refers to the message
    format version currently in use. If you have previously overridden
    the message format version, you should keep its current value.
    Alternatively, if you are upgrading from a version prior to
    0.11.0.x, then CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION should be set to match
    CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. 0.8.2,
        0.9.0, 0.10.0, 0.10.1, 0.10.2, 0.11.0, 1.0, 1.1).
    -   log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See
        [potential performance impact following the upgrade](#upgrade_10_performance_impact) for the details on what
        this configuration does.)

    If you are upgrading from 0.11.0.x, 1.0.x, 1.1.x, or 2.0.x and you
    have not overridden the message format, then you only need to
    override the inter-broker protocol version.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (0.11.0,
        1.0, 1.1, 2.0).
2.  Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the
    code, and restart it. Once you have done so, the brokers will be
    running the latest version and you can verify that the cluster\'s
    behavior and performance meets expectations. It is still possible to
    downgrade at this point if there are any problems.
3.  Once the cluster\'s behavior and performance has been verified, bump
    the protocol version by editing `inter.broker.protocol.version` and
    setting it to 2.2.
4.  Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take
    effect. Once the brokers begin using the latest protocol version, it
    will no longer be possible to downgrade the cluster to an older
    version.
5.  If you have overridden the message format version as instructed
    above, then you need to do one more rolling restart to upgrade it to
    its latest version. Once all (or most) consumers have been upgraded
    to 0.11.0 or later, change log.message.format.version to 2.2 on each
    broker and restart them one by one. Note that the older Scala
    clients, which are no longer maintained, do not support the message
    format introduced in 0.11, so to avoid conversion costs (or to take
    advantage of [exactly once semantics](#upgrade_11_exactly_once_semantics)), the newer Java
    clients must be used.

### Notable changes in 2.2.1 {#upgrade_221_notable}

-   Kafka Streams 2.2.1 requires 0.11 message format or higher and does
    not work with older message format.

### [Notable changes in 2.2.0](#upgrade_220_notable){#upgrade_220_notable}

-   The default consumer group id has been changed from the empty string
    (`""`) to `null`. Consumers who use the new default group id will
    not be able to subscribe to topics, and fetch or commit offsets. The
    empty string as consumer group id is deprecated but will be
    supported until a future major release. Old clients that rely on the
    empty string group id will now have to explicitly provide it as part
    of their consumer config. For more information see
    [KIP-289](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-289%3A+Improve+the+default+group+id+behavior+in+KafkaConsumer).
-   The `bin/kafka-topics.sh` command line tool is now able to connect
    directly to brokers with `--bootstrap-server` instead of zookeeper.
    The old `--zookeeper` option is still available for now. Please read
    [KIP-377](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-377%3A+TopicCommand+to+use+AdminClient)
    for more information.
-   Kafka Streams depends on a newer version of RocksDBs that requires
    MacOS 10.13 or higher.

## Upgrading from 0.8.x, 0.9.x, 0.10.0.x, 0.10.1.x, 0.10.2.x, 0.11.0.x, 1.0.x, 1.1.x, or 2.0.0 to 2.1.0 {#upgrade_2_1_0}

**Note that 2.1.x contains a change to the internal schema used to store
consumer offsets. Once the upgrade is complete, it will not be possible
to downgrade to previous versions. See the rolling upgrade notes below
for more detail.**

**For a rolling upgrade:**

1.  Update server.properties on all brokers and add the following
    properties. CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION refers to the version you are

    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. 0.8.2,
        0.9.0, 0.10.0, 0.10.1, 0.10.2, 0.11.0, 1.0, 1.1).
    -   log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See
        [potential performance impact following the upgrade](#upgrade_10_performance_impact) for the details on what
        this configuration does.)

    If you are upgrading from 0.11.0.x, 1.0.x, 1.1.x, or 2.0.x and you
    have not overridden the message format, then you only need to
    override the inter-broker protocol version.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (0.11.0,
        1.0, 1.1, 2.0).
2.  Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the
    code, and restart it. Once you have done so, the brokers will be
    running the latest version and you can verify that the cluster\'s
    behavior and performance meets expectations. It is still possible to

4.  Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take

    version.
5.  If you have overridden the message format version as instructed
    above, then you need to do one more rolling restart to upgrade it to
    its latest version. Once all (or most) consumers have been upgraded
    to 0.11.0 or later, change log.message.format.version to 2.1 on each

    format introduced in 0.11, so to avoid conversion costs (or to take
    advantage of [exactly once semantics](#upgrade_11_exactly_once_semantics)), the newer Java
    clients must be used.

**Additional Upgrade Notes:**

1.  Offset expiration semantics has slightly changed in this version.
    According to the new semantics, offsets of partitions in a group
    will not be removed while the group is subscribed to the
    corresponding topic and is still active (has active consumers). If
    group becomes empty all its offsets will be removed after default
    offset retention period (or the one set by broker) has passed
    (unless the group becomes active again). Offsets associated with
    standalone (simple) consumers, that do not use Kafka group
    management, will be removed after default offset retention period
    (or the one set by broker) has passed since their last commit.
2.  The default for console consumer\'s `enable.auto.commit` property
    when no `group.id` is provided is now set to `false`. This is to
    avoid polluting the consumer coordinator cache as the auto-generated
    group is not likely to be used by other consumers.
3.  The default value for the producer\'s `retries` config was changed
    to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, as we introduced `delivery.timeout.ms` in
    [KIP-91](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-91+Provide+Intuitive+User+Timeouts+in+The+Producer),
    which sets an upper bound on the total time between sending a record
    and receiving acknowledgement from the broker. By default, the
    delivery timeout is set to 2 minutes.
4.  By default, MirrorMaker now overrides `delivery.timeout.ms` to
    `Integer.MAX_VALUE` when configuring the producer. If you have
    overridden the value of `retries` in order to fail faster, you will
    instead need to override `delivery.timeout.ms`.
5.  The `ListGroup` API now expects, as a recommended alternative,
    `Describe Group` access to the groups a user should be able to list.
    Even though the old `Describe Cluster` access is still supported for
    backward compatibility, using it for this API is not advised.
6.  [KIP-336](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=87298242)
    deprecates the ExtendedSerializer and ExtendedDeserializer
    interfaces and propagates the usage of Serializer and Deserializer.
    ExtendedSerializer and ExtendedDeserializer were introduced with
    [KIP-82](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-82+-+Add+Record+Headers)
    to provide record headers for serializers and deserializers in a
    Java 7 compatible fashion. Now we consolidated these interfaces as
    Java 7 support has been dropped since.

### Notable changes in 2.1.0 {#upgrade_210_notable}

-   Jetty has been upgraded to 9.4.12, which excludes TLS_RSA\_\*
    ciphers by default because they do not support forward secrecy, see
    https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/2807 for more
    information.
-   Unclean leader election is automatically enabled by the controller
    when `unclean.leader.election.enable` config is dynamically updated
    by using per-topic config override.
-   The `AdminClient` has added a method `AdminClient#metrics()`. Now
    any application using the `AdminClient` can gain more information
    and insight by viewing the metrics captured from the `AdminClient`.
    For more information see
    [KIP-324](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-324%3A+Add+method+to+get+metrics%28%29+in+AdminClient)
-   Kafka now supports Zstandard compression from
    [KIP-110](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-110%3A+Add+Codec+for+ZStandard+Compression).
    You must upgrade the broker as well as clients to make use of it.
    Consumers prior to 2.1.0 will not be able to read from topics which
    use Zstandard compression, so you should not enable it for a topic
    until all downstream consumers are upgraded. See the KIP for more
    detail.

## Upgrading from 0.8.x, 0.9.x, 0.10.0.x, 0.10.1.x, 0.10.2.x, 0.11.0.x, 1.0.x, or 1.1.x to 2.0.0 {#upgrade_2_0_0}

Kafka 2.0.0 introduces wire protocol changes. By following the
recommended rolling upgrade plan below, you guarantee no downtime during
the upgrade. However, please review the [notable changes in
2.0.0](#upgrade_200_notable) before upgrading.

**For a rolling upgrade:**

1.  Update server.properties on all brokers and add the following
    properties. CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION refers to the version you are
    upgrading from. CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION refers to the message
    format version currently in use. If you have previously overridden
    the message format version, you should keep its current value.
    Alternatively, if you are upgrading from a version prior to
    0.11.0.x, then CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION should be set to match
    CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. 0.8.2,
        0.9.0, 0.10.0, 0.10.1, 0.10.2, 0.11.0, 1.0, 1.1).
    -   log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See
        [potential performance impact following the upgrade](#upgrade_10_performance_impact) for the details on what
        this configuration does.)

    If you are upgrading from 0.11.0.x, 1.0.x, or 1.1.x and you have not
    overridden the message format, then you only need to override the
    inter-broker protocol format.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (0.11.0,
        1.0, 1.1).
2.  Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the
    code, and restart it.
3.  Once the entire cluster is upgraded, bump the protocol version by
    editing `inter.broker.protocol.version` and setting it to 2.0.
4.  Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take
    effect.
5.  If you have overridden the message format version as instructed
    above, then you need to do one more rolling restart to upgrade it to
    its latest version. Once all (or most) consumers have been upgraded
    to 0.11.0 or later, change log.message.format.version to 2.0 on each
    broker and restart them one by one. Note that the older Scala
    consumer does not support the new message format introduced in 0.11,
    so to avoid the performance cost of down-conversion (or to take
    advantage of [exactly once semantics](#upgrade_11_exactly_once_semantics)), the newer Java
    consumer must be used.

**Additional Upgrade Notes:**

1.  If you are willing to accept downtime, you can simply take all the
    brokers down, update the code and start them back up. They will
    start with the new protocol by default.

2.  Bumping the protocol version and restarting can be done any time
    after the brokers are upgraded. It does not have to be immediately
    after. Similarly for the message format version.

3.  If you are using Java8 method references in your Kafka Streams code
    you might need to update your code to resolve method ambiguities.
    Hot-swapping the jar-file only might not work.

4.  ACLs should not be added to prefixed resources, (added in
    [KIP-290](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-290%3A+Support+for+Prefixed+ACLs)),
    until all brokers in the cluster have been updated.

    **NOTE:** any prefixed ACLs added to a cluster, even after the
    cluster is fully upgraded, will be ignored should the cluster be
    downgraded again.

### Notable changes in 2.0.0 {#upgrade_200_notable}

-   [KIP-186](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/oYtjB) increases the
    default offset retention time from 1 day to 7 days. This makes it
    less likely to \"lose\" offsets in an application that commits
    infrequently. It also increases the active set of offsets and
    therefore can increase memory usage on the broker. Note that the
    console consumer currently enables offset commit by default and can
    be the source of a large number of offsets which this change will
    now preserve for 7 days instead of 1. You can preserve the existing
    behavior by setting the broker config `offsets.retention.minutes` to
    1440.

-   Support for Java 7 has been dropped, Java 8 is now the minimum
    version required.

-   The default value for `ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm` was
    changed to `https`, which performs hostname verification
    (man-in-the-middle attacks are possible otherwise). Set
    `ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm` to an empty string to
    restore the previous behaviour.

-   [KAFKA-5674](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-5674)
    extends the lower interval of `max.connections.per.ip` minimum to
    zero and therefore allows IP-based filtering of inbound connections.

-   [KIP-272](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-272%3A+Add+API+version+tag+to+broker%27s+RequestsPerSec+metric)
    added API version tag to the metric
    `kafka.network:type=RequestMetrics,name=RequestsPerSec,request={Produce|FetchConsumer|FetchFollower|...}`.
    This metric now becomes
    `kafka.network:type=RequestMetrics,name=RequestsPerSec,request={Produce|FetchConsumer|FetchFollower|...},version={0|1|2|3|...}`.
    This will impact JMX monitoring tools that do not automatically
    aggregate. To get the total count for a specific request type, the
    tool needs to be updated to aggregate across different versions.

-   [KIP-225](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/uaBzB) changed the
    metric \"records.lag\" to use tags for topic and partition. The
    original version with the name format
    \"{topic}-{partition}.records-lag\" has been removed.

-   The Scala consumers, which have been deprecated since 0.11.0.0, have
    been removed. The Java consumer has been the recommended option
    since 0.10.0.0. Note that the Scala consumers in 1.1.0 (and older)
    will continue to work even if the brokers are upgraded to 2.0.0.

-   The Scala producers, which have been deprecated since 0.10.0.0, have
    been removed. The Java producer has been the recommended option
    since 0.9.0.0. Note that the behaviour of the default partitioner in
    the Java producer differs from the default partitioner in the Scala
    producers. Users migrating should consider configuring a custom
    partitioner that retains the previous behaviour. Note that the Scala
    producers in 1.1.0 (and older) will continue to work even if the
    brokers are upgraded to 2.0.0.

-   MirrorMaker and ConsoleConsumer no longer support the Scala
    consumer, they always use the Java consumer.

-   The ConsoleProducer no longer supports the Scala producer, it always
    uses the Java producer.

-   A number of deprecated tools that rely on the Scala clients have
    been removed: ReplayLogProducer, SimpleConsumerPerformance,
    SimpleConsumerShell, ExportZkOffsets, ImportZkOffsets,
    UpdateOffsetsInZK, VerifyConsumerRebalance.

-   The deprecated kafka.tools.ProducerPerformance has been removed,
    please use org.apache.kafka.tools.ProducerPerformance.

-   New Kafka Streams configuration parameter `upgrade.from` added that
    allows rolling bounce upgrade from older version.

-   [KIP-284](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/DVyHB) changed the
    retention time for Kafka Streams repartition topics by setting its
    default value to `Long.MAX_VALUE`.

-   Updated `ProcessorStateManager` APIs in Kafka Streams for
    registering state stores to the processor topology. For more details
    please read the Streams [Upgrade Guide](../streams/upgrade-guide#streams_api_changes_200).

-   In earlier releases, Connect\'s worker configuration required the
    `internal.key.converter` and `internal.value.converter` properties.
    In 2.0, these are [no longer required](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/AZQ7B) and default
    to the JSON converter. You may safely remove these properties from
    your Connect standalone and distributed worker configurations:\
    `internal.key.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter`
    `internal.key.converter.schemas.enable=false`
    `internal.value.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter`
    `internal.value.converter.schemas.enable=false`

-   [KIP-266](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/5kiHB) adds a new
    consumer configuration `default.api.timeout.ms` to specify the
    default timeout to use for `KafkaConsumer` APIs that could block.
    The KIP also adds overloads for such blocking APIs to support
    specifying a specific timeout to use for each of them instead of
    using the default timeout set by `default.api.timeout.ms`. In
    particular, a new `poll(Duration)` API has been added which does not
    block for dynamic partition assignment. The old `poll(long)` API has
    been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Overloads
    have also been added for other `KafkaConsumer` methods like
    `partitionsFor`, `listTopics`, `offsetsForTimes`,
    `beginningOffsets`, `endOffsets` and `close` that take in a
    `Duration`.

-   Also as part of KIP-266, the default value of `request.timeout.ms`
    has been changed to 30 seconds. The previous value was a little
    higher than 5 minutes to account for maximum time that a rebalance
    would take. Now we treat the JoinGroup request in the rebalance as a
    special case and use a value derived from `max.poll.interval.ms` for
    the request timeout. All other request types use the timeout defined
    by `request.timeout.ms`

-   The internal method `kafka.admin.AdminClient.deleteRecordsBefore`
    has been removed. Users are encouraged to migrate to
    `org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.AdminClient.deleteRecords`.

-   The AclCommand tool `--producer` convenience option uses the
    [KIP-277](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-277+-+Fine+Grained+ACL+for+CreateTopics+API)
    finer grained ACL on the given topic.

-   [KIP-176](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-176%3A+Remove+deprecated+new-consumer+option+for+tools)
    removes the `--new-consumer` option for all consumer based tools.
    This option is redundant since the new consumer is automatically
    used if \--bootstrap-server is defined.

-   [KIP-290](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-290%3A+Support+for+Prefixed+ACLs)
    adds the ability to define ACLs on prefixed resources, e.g. any
    topic starting with \'foo\'.

-   [KIP-283](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-283%3A+Efficient+Memory+Usage+for+Down-Conversion)
    improves message down-conversion handling on Kafka broker, which has
    typically been a memory-intensive operation. The KIP adds a
    mechanism by which the operation becomes less memory intensive by
    down-converting chunks of partition data at a time which helps put
    an upper bound on memory consumption. With this improvement, there
    is a change in `FetchResponse` protocol behavior where the broker
    could send an oversized message batch towards the end of the
    response with an invalid offset. Such oversized messages must be
    ignored by consumer clients, as is done by `KafkaConsumer`.

    KIP-283 also adds new topic and broker configurations
    `message.downconversion.enable` and
    `log.message.downconversion.enable` respectively to control whether
    down-conversion is enabled. When disabled, broker does not perform
    any down-conversion and instead sends an `UNSUPPORTED_VERSION` error
    to the client.

-   Dynamic broker configuration options can be stored in ZooKeeper
    using kafka-configs.sh before brokers are started. This option can
    be used to avoid storing clear passwords in server.properties as all
    password configs may be stored encrypted in ZooKeeper.

-   ZooKeeper hosts are now re-resolved if connection attempt fails. But
    if your ZooKeeper host names resolve to multiple addresses and some
    of them are not reachable, then you may need to increase the
    connection timeout `zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms`.

### New Protocol Versions {#upgrade_200_new_protocols}

-   [KIP-279](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-279%3A+Fix+log+divergence+between+leader+and+follower+after+fast+leader+fail+over):
    OffsetsForLeaderEpochResponse v1 introduces a partition-level
    `leader_epoch` field.
-   [KIP-219](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-219+-+Improve+quota+communication):
    Bump up the protocol versions of non-cluster action requests and
    responses that are throttled on quota violation.
-   [KIP-290](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-290%3A+Support+for+Prefixed+ACLs):
    Bump up the protocol versions ACL create, describe and delete
    requests and responses.

### Upgrading a 1.1 Kafka Streams Application {#upgrade_200_streams_from_11}

-   Upgrading your Streams application from 1.1 to 2.0 does not require
    a broker upgrade. A Kafka Streams 2.0 application can connect to
    2.0, 1.1, 1.0, 0.11.0, 0.10.2 and 0.10.1 brokers (it is not possible
    to connect to 0.10.0 brokers though).
-   Note that in 2.0 we have removed the public APIs that are deprecated
    prior to 1.0; users leveraging on those deprecated APIs need to make
    code changes accordingly. See [Streams API changes in
    2.0.0](../streams/upgrade-guide#streams_api_changes_200)
    for more details.

## Upgrading from 0.8.x, 0.9.x, 0.10.0.x, 0.10.1.x, 0.10.2.x, 0.11.0.x, or 1.0.x to 1.1.x {#upgrade_1_1_0}

Kafka 1.1.0 introduces wire protocol changes. By following the
recommended rolling upgrade plan below, you guarantee no downtime during
the upgrade. However, please review the [notable changes in
1.1.0](#upgrade_110_notable) before upgrading.

**For a rolling upgrade:**

1.  Update server.properties on all brokers and add the following
    properties. CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION refers to the version you are
    upgrading from. CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION refers to the message
    format version currently in use. If you have previously overridden
    the message format version, you should keep its current value.
    Alternatively, if you are upgrading from a version prior to
    0.11.0.x, then CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION should be set to match
    CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. 0.8.2,
        0.9.0, 0.10.0, 0.10.1, 0.10.2, 0.11.0, 1.0).
    -   log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See
        [potential performance impact following the upgrade](#upgrade_10_performance_impact) for the details on what
        this configuration does.)

    If you are upgrading from 0.11.0.x or 1.0.x and you have not
    overridden the message format, then you only need to override the
    inter-broker protocol format.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (0.11.0 or
        1.0).
2.  Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the
    code, and restart it.
3.  Once the entire cluster is upgraded, bump the protocol version by
    editing `inter.broker.protocol.version` and setting it to 1.1.
4.  Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take
    effect.
5.  If you have overridden the message format version as instructed
    above, then you need to do one more rolling restart to upgrade it to
    its latest version. Once all (or most) consumers have been upgraded
    to 0.11.0 or later, change log.message.format.version to 1.1 on each
    broker and restart them one by one. Note that the older Scala
    consumer does not support the new message format introduced in 0.11,
    so to avoid the performance cost of down-conversion (or to take
    advantage of [exactly once semantics](#upgrade_11_exactly_once_semantics)), the newer Java
    consumer must be used.

**Additional Upgrade Notes:**

1.  If you are willing to accept downtime, you can simply take all the
    brokers down, update the code and start them back up. They will
    start with the new protocol by default.
2.  Bumping the protocol version and restarting can be done any time
    after the brokers are upgraded. It does not have to be immediately
    after. Similarly for the message format version.
3.  If you are using Java8 method references in your Kafka Streams code
    you might need to update your code to resolve method ambiguties.
    Hot-swapping the jar-file only might not work.

### Notable changes in 1.1.1 {#upgrade_111_notable}

-   New Kafka Streams configuration parameter `upgrade.from` added that
    allows rolling bounce upgrade from version 0.10.0.x
-   See the [**Kafka Streams upgrade guide**](../streams/upgrade-guide.html)
    for details about this new config.

### Notable changes in 1.1.0 {#upgrade_110_notable}

-   The kafka artifact in Maven no longer depends on log4j or
    slf4j-log4j12. Similarly to the kafka-clients artifact, users can
    now choose the logging back-end by including the appropriate slf4j
    module (slf4j-log4j12, logback, etc.). The release tarball still
    includes log4j and slf4j-log4j12.
-   [KIP-225](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/uaBzB) changed the
    metric \"records.lag\" to use tags for topic and partition. The
    original version with the name format
    \"{topic}-{partition}.records-lag\" is deprecated and will be
    removed in 2.0.0.
-   Kafka Streams is more robust against broker communication errors.
    Instead of stopping the Kafka Streams client with a fatal exception,
    Kafka Streams tries to self-heal and reconnect to the cluster. Using
    the new `AdminClient` you have better control of how often Kafka
    Streams retries and can
    [configure](/{{< param akVersion >}}/documentation/streams/developer-guide/config-streams)
    fine-grained timeouts (instead of hard coded retries as in older
    version).
-   Kafka Streams rebalance time was reduced further making Kafka
    Streams more responsive.
-   Kafka Connect now supports message headers in both sink and source
    connectors, and to manipulate them via simple message transforms.
    Connectors must be changed to explicitly use them. A new
    `HeaderConverter` is introduced to control how headers are
    (de)serialized, and the new \"SimpleHeaderConverter\" is used by
    default to use string representations of values.
-   kafka.tools.DumpLogSegments now automatically sets deep-iteration
    option if print-data-log is enabled explicitly or implicitly due to
    any of the other options like decoder.

### New Protocol Versions {#upgrade_110_new_protocols}

-   [KIP-226](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-226+-+Dynamic+Broker+Configuration)
    introduced DescribeConfigs Request/Response v1.
-   [KIP-227](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-227%3A+Introduce+Incremental+FetchRequests+to+Increase+Partition+Scalability)
    introduced Fetch Request/Response v7.

### Upgrading a 1.0 Kafka Streams Application {#upgrade_110_streams_from_10}

-   Upgrading your Streams application from 1.0 to 1.1 does not require
    a broker upgrade. A Kafka Streams 1.1 application can connect to
    1.0, 0.11.0, 0.10.2 and 0.10.1 brokers (it is not possible to
    connect to 0.10.0 brokers though).
-   See [Streams API changes in
    1.1.0](../streams/upgrade-guide#streams_api_changes_110)
    for more details.

## Upgrading from 0.8.x, 0.9.x, 0.10.0.x, 0.10.1.x, 0.10.2.x or 0.11.0.x to 1.0.0 {#upgrade_1_0_0}

Kafka 1.0.0 introduces wire protocol changes. By following the
recommended rolling upgrade plan below, you guarantee no downtime during
the upgrade. However, please review the [notable changes in 1.0.0](#upgrade_100_notable) before upgrading.

**For a rolling upgrade:**

1.  Update server.properties on all brokers and add the following
    properties. CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION refers to the version you are
    upgrading from. CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION refers to the message
    format version currently in use. If you have previously overridden
    the message format version, you should keep its current value.
    Alternatively, if you are upgrading from a version prior to
    0.11.0.x, then CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION should be set to match
    CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. 0.8.2,
        0.9.0, 0.10.0, 0.10.1, 0.10.2, 0.11.0).
    -   log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See
        [potential performance impact following the upgrade](#upgrade_10_performance_impact) for the details on what
        this configuration does.)

    If you are upgrading from 0.11.0.x and you have not overridden the
    message format, you must set both the message format version and the
    inter-broker protocol version to 0.11.0.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=0.11.0
    -   log.message.format.version=0.11.0
2.  Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the
    code, and restart it.
3.  Once the entire cluster is upgraded, bump the protocol version by
    editing `inter.broker.protocol.version` and setting it to 1.0.
4.  Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take
    effect.
5.  If you have overridden the message format version as instructed
    above, then you need to do one more rolling restart to upgrade it to
    its latest version. Once all (or most) consumers have been upgraded
    to 0.11.0 or later, change log.message.format.version to 1.0 on each
    broker and restart them one by one. If you are upgrading from 0.11.0
    and log.message.format.version is set to 0.11.0, you can update the
    config and skip the rolling restart. Note that the older Scala
    consumer does not support the new message format introduced in 0.11,
    so to avoid the performance cost of down-conversion (or to take
    advantage of [exactly once semantics](#upgrade_11_exactly_once_semantics)), the newer Java
    consumer must be used.

**Additional Upgrade Notes:**

1.  If you are willing to accept downtime, you can simply take all the
    brokers down, update the code and start them back up. They will
    start with the new protocol by default.
2.  Bumping the protocol version and restarting can be done any time
    after the brokers are upgraded. It does not have to be immediately
    after. Similarly for the message format version.

### Notable changes in 1.0.2 {#upgrade_102_notable}

-   New Kafka Streams configuration parameter `upgrade.from` added that
    allows rolling bounce upgrade from version 0.10.0.x
-   See the [**Kafka Streams upgrade guide**](../streams/upgrade-guide.html)
    for details about this new config.

### Notable changes in 1.0.1 {#upgrade_101_notable}

-   Restored binary compatibility of AdminClient\'s Options classes
    (e.g. CreateTopicsOptions, DeleteTopicsOptions, etc.) with 0.11.0.x.
    Binary (but not source) compatibility had been broken inadvertently
    in 1.0.0.

### Notable changes in 1.0.0 {#upgrade_100_notable}

-   Topic deletion is now enabled by default, since the functionality is
    now stable. Users who wish to to retain the previous behavior should
    set the broker config `delete.topic.enable` to `false`. Keep in mind
    that topic deletion removes data and the operation is not reversible
    (i.e. there is no \"undelete\" operation)
-   For topics that support timestamp search if no offset can be found
    for a partition, that partition is now included in the search result
    with a null offset value. Previously, the partition was not included
    in the map. This change was made to make the search behavior
    consistent with the case of topics not supporting timestamp search.
-   If the `inter.broker.protocol.version` is 1.0 or later, a broker
    will now stay online to serve replicas on live log directories even
    if there are offline log directories. A log directory may become
    offline due to IOException caused by hardware failure. Users need to
    monitor the per-broker metric `offlineLogDirectoryCount` to check
    whether there is offline log directory.
-   Added KafkaStorageException which is a retriable exception.
    KafkaStorageException will be converted to
    NotLeaderForPartitionException in the response if the version of the
    client\'s FetchRequest or ProducerRequest does not support
    KafkaStorageException.
-   -XX:+DisableExplicitGC was replaced by
    -XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent in the default JVM settings. This
    helps avoid out of memory exceptions during allocation of native
    memory by direct buffers in some cases.
-   The overridden `handleError` method implementations have been
    removed from the following deprecated classes in the `kafka.api`
    package: `FetchRequest`, `GroupCoordinatorRequest`,
    `OffsetCommitRequest`, `OffsetFetchRequest`, `OffsetRequest`,
    `ProducerRequest`, and `TopicMetadataRequest`. This was only
    intended for use on the broker, but it is no longer in use and the
    implementations have not been maintained. A stub implementation has
    been retained for binary compatibility.
-   The Java clients and tools now accept any string as a client-id.
-   The deprecated tool `kafka-consumer-offset-checker.sh` has been
    removed. Use `kafka-consumer-groups.sh` to get consumer group
    details.
-   SimpleAclAuthorizer now logs access denials to the authorizer log by
    default.
-   Authentication failures are now reported to clients as one of the
    subclasses of `AuthenticationException`. No retries will be
    performed if a client connection fails authentication.
-   Custom `SaslServer` implementations may throw
    `SaslAuthenticationException` to provide an error message to return
    to clients indicating the reason for authentication failure.
    Implementors should take care not to include any security-critical
    information in the exception message that should not be leaked to
    unauthenticated clients.
-   The `app-info` mbean registered with JMX to provide version and
    commit id will be deprecated and replaced with metrics providing
    these attributes.
-   Kafka metrics may now contain non-numeric values.
    `org.apache.kafka.common.Metric#value()` has been deprecated and
    will return `0.0` in such cases to minimise the probability of
    breaking users who read the value of every client metric (via a
    `MetricsReporter` implementation or by calling the `metrics()`
    method). `org.apache.kafka.common.Metric#metricValue()` can be used
    to retrieve numeric and non-numeric metric values.
-   Every Kafka rate metric now has a corresponding cumulative count
    metric with the suffix `-total` to simplify downstream processing.
    For example, `records-consumed-rate` has a corresponding metric
    named `records-consumed-total`.
-   Mx4j will only be enabled if the system property `kafka_mx4jenable`
    is set to `true`. Due to a logic inversion bug, it was previously
    enabled by default and disabled if `kafka_mx4jenable` was set to
    `true`.
-   The package `org.apache.kafka.common.security.auth` in the clients
    jar has been made public and added to the javadocs. Internal classes
    which had previously been located in this package have been moved
    elsewhere.
-   When using an Authorizer and a user doesn\'t have required
    permissions on a topic, the broker will return
    TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED errors to requests irrespective of topic
    existence on broker. If the user have required permissions and the
    topic doesn\'t exists, then the UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION error
    code will be returned.
-   config/consumer.properties file updated to use new consumer config
    properties.

### New Protocol Versions {#upgrade_100_new_protocols}

    authentication failures. This request will be used if the
    SaslHandshake request version is greater than 0.

### Upgrading a 0.11.0 Kafka Streams Application {#upgrade_100_streams_from_0110}

-   Upgrading your Streams application from 0.11.0 to 1.0 does not
    require a broker upgrade. A Kafka Streams 1.0 application can
    connect to 0.11.0, 0.10.2 and 0.10.1 brokers (it is not possible to
    connect to 0.10.0 brokers though). However, Kafka Streams 1.0
    requires 0.10 message format or newer and does not work with older
    message formats.
-   If you are monitoring on streams metrics, you will need make some
    changes to the metrics names in your reporting and monitoring code,
    because the metrics sensor hierarchy was changed.
-   There are a few public APIs including `ProcessorContext#schedule()`,
    `Processor#punctuate()` and `KStreamBuilder`, `TopologyBuilder` are
    being deprecated by new APIs. We recommend making corresponding code
    changes, which should be very minor since the new APIs look quite
    similar, when you upgrade.
-   See [Streams API changes in 1.0.0](../streams/upgrade-guide#streams_api_changes_100)
    for more details.

### Upgrading a 0.10.2 Kafka Streams Application {#upgrade_100_streams_from_0102}

-   Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.2 to 1.0 does not
    require a broker upgrade. A Kafka Streams 1.0 application can
    connect to 1.0, 0.11.0, 0.10.2 and 0.10.1 brokers (it is not
    possible to connect to 0.10.0 brokers though).
-   If you are monitoring on streams metrics, you will need make some
    changes to the metrics names in your reporting and monitoring code,
    because the metrics sensor hierarchy was changed.
-   There are a few public APIs including `ProcessorContext#schedule()`,
    `Processor#punctuate()` and `KStreamBuilder`, `TopologyBuilder` are
    being deprecated by new APIs. We recommend making corresponding code
    changes, which should be very minor since the new APIs look quite
    similar, when you upgrade.
-   If you specify customized `key.serde`, `value.serde` and
    `timestamp.extractor` in configs, it is recommended to use their
    replaced configure parameter as these configs are deprecated.
-   See [Streams API changes in 0.11.0](../streams/upgrade-guide#streams_api_changes_0110)
    for more details.

### Upgrading a 0.10.1 Kafka Streams Application {#upgrade_100_streams_from_0101}

-   Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.1 to 1.0 does not
    require a broker upgrade. A Kafka Streams 1.0 application can
    connect to 1.0, 0.11.0, 0.10.2 and 0.10.1 brokers (it is not
    possible to connect to 0.10.0 brokers though).
-   You need to recompile your code. Just swapping the Kafka Streams
    library jar file will not work and will break your application.
-   If you are monitoring on streams metrics, you will need make some
    changes to the metrics names in your reporting and monitoring code,
    because the metrics sensor hierarchy was changed.
-   There are a few public APIs including `ProcessorContext#schedule()`,
    `Processor#punctuate()` and `KStreamBuilder`, `TopologyBuilder` are
    being deprecated by new APIs. We recommend making corresponding code
    changes, which should be very minor since the new APIs look quite
    similar, when you upgrade.
-   If you specify customized `key.serde`, `value.serde` and
    `timestamp.extractor` in configs, it is recommended to use their
    replaced configure parameter as these configs are deprecated.
-   If you use a custom (i.e., user implemented) timestamp extractor,
    you will need to update this code, because the `TimestampExtractor`
    interface was changed.
-   If you register custom metrics, you will need to update this code,
    because the `StreamsMetric` interface was changed.
-   See [Streams API changes in 1.0.0](../streams/upgrade-guide#streams_api_changes_100),
    [Streams API changes in 0.11.0](../streams/upgrade-guide#streams_api_changes_0110)
    and [Streams API changes in 0.10.2](../streams/upgrade-guide#streams_api_changes_0102)
    for more details.

### Upgrading a 0.10.0 Kafka Streams Application {#upgrade_100_streams_from_0100}

-   Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.0 to 1.0 does require a
    [broker upgrade](#upgrade_10_1) because a Kafka Streams 1.0
    application can only connect to 0.1, 0.11.0, 0.10.2, or 0.10.1
    brokers.
-   There are couple of API changes, that are not backward compatible
    (cf. [Streams API changes in 1.0.0](../streams/upgrade-guide#streams_api_changes_100),
    [Streams API changes in
    0.11.0](/{{< param akVersion >}}/documentation/streams#streams_api_changes_0110),
    [Streams API changes in
    0.10.2](/{{< param akVersion >}}/documentation/streams#streams_api_changes_0102),
    and [Streams API changes in
    0.10.1](/{{< param akVersion >}}/documentation/streams#streams_api_changes_0101)
    for more details). Thus, you need to update and recompile your code.
    Just swapping the Kafka Streams library jar file will not work and
    will break your application.
-   Upgrading from 0.10.0.x to 1.0.2 requires two rolling bounces with
    config `upgrade.from="0.10.0"` set for first upgrade phase (cf.
    [KIP-268](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-268%3A+Simplify+Kafka+Streams+Rebalance+Metadata+Upgrade)).
    As an alternative, an offline upgrade is also possible.
    -   prepare your application instances for a rolling bounce and make
        sure that config `upgrade.from` is set to `"0.10.0"` for new
        version 0.11.0.3
    -   bounce each instance of your application once
    -   prepare your newly deployed 1.0.2 application instances for a
        second round of rolling bounces; make sure to remove the value
        for config `upgrade.from`
    -   bounce each instance of your application once more to complete
        the upgrade
-   Upgrading from 0.10.0.x to 1.0.0 or 1.0.1 requires an offline
    upgrade (rolling bounce upgrade is not supported)
    -   stop all old (0.10.0.x) application instances
    -   update your code and swap old code and jar file with new code
        and new jar file
    -   restart all new (1.0.0 or 1.0.1) application instances

## Upgrading from 0.8.x, 0.9.x, 0.10.0.x, 0.10.1.x or 0.10.2.x to 0.11.0.0 {#upgrade_11_0_0}

Kafka 0.11.0.0 introduces a new message format version as well as wire
protocol changes. By following the recommended rolling upgrade plan
below, you guarantee no downtime during the upgrade. However, please
review the [notable changes in 0.11.0.0](#upgrade_1100_notable) before
upgrading.

Starting with version 0.10.2, Java clients (producer and consumer) have
acquired the ability to communicate with older brokers. Version 0.11.0
clients can talk to version 0.10.0 or newer brokers. However, if your
brokers are older than 0.10.0, you must upgrade all the brokers in the
Kafka cluster before upgrading your clients. Version 0.11.0 brokers
support 0.8.x and newer clients.

**For a rolling upgrade:**

1.  Update server.properties on all brokers and add the following
    properties. CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION refers to the version you are
    upgrading from. CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION refers to the current
    message format version currently in use. If you have not overridden
    the message format previously, then CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION
    should be set to match CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION.
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. 0.8.2,
        0.9.0, 0.10.0, 0.10.1 or 0.10.2).
    -   log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See
        [potential performance impact following the upgrade](#upgrade_10_performance_impact) for the details on what
        this configuration does.)
2.  Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the
    code, and restart it.
3.  Once the entire cluster is upgraded, bump the protocol version by
    editing `inter.broker.protocol.version` and setting it to 0.11.0,
    but do not change `log.message.format.version` yet.
4.  Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take
    effect.
5.  Once all (or most) consumers have been upgraded to 0.11.0 or later,
    then change log.message.format.version to 0.11.0 on each broker and
    restart them one by one. Note that the older Scala consumer does not
    support the new message format, so to avoid the performance cost of
    down-conversion (or to take advantage of [exactly once semantics](#upgrade_11_exactly_once_semantics)), the new Java
    consumer must be used.

**Additional Upgrade Notes:**

1.  If you are willing to accept downtime, you can simply take all the
    brokers down, update the code and start them back up. They will
    start with the new protocol by default.
2.  Bumping the protocol version and restarting can be done any time
    after the brokers are upgraded. It does not have to be immediately
    after. Similarly for the message format version.
3.  It is also possible to enable the 0.11.0 message format on
    individual topics using the topic admin tool (`bin/kafka-topics.sh`)
    prior to updating the global setting `log.message.format.version`.
4.  If you are upgrading from a version prior to 0.10.0, it is NOT
    necessary to first update the message format to 0.10.0 before you
    switch to 0.11.0.

### Upgrading a 0.10.2 Kafka Streams Application {#upgrade_1100_streams_from_0102}

-   Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.2 to 0.11.0 does not
    require a broker upgrade. A Kafka Streams 0.11.0 application can
    connect to 0.11.0, 0.10.2 and 0.10.1 brokers (it is not possible to
    connect to 0.10.0 brokers though).
-   If you specify customized `key.serde`, `value.serde` and
    `timestamp.extractor` in configs, it is recommended to use their
    replaced configure parameter as these configs are deprecated.
-   See [Streams API changes in 0.11.0](../streams/upgrade-guide#streams_api_changes_0110)
    for more details.

### Upgrading a 0.10.1 Kafka Streams Application {#upgrade_1100_streams_from_0101}

-   Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.1 to 0.11.0 does not
    require a broker upgrade. A Kafka Streams 0.11.0 application can
    connect to 0.11.0, 0.10.2 and 0.10.1 brokers (it is not possible to
    connect to 0.10.0 brokers though).
-   You need to recompile your code. Just swapping the Kafka Streams
    library jar file will not work and will break your application.
-   If you specify customized `key.serde`, `value.serde` and
    `timestamp.extractor` in configs, it is recommended to use their
    replaced configure parameter as these configs are deprecated.
-   If you use a custom (i.e., user implemented) timestamp extractor,
    you will need to update this code, because the `TimestampExtractor`
    interface was changed.
-   If you register custom metrics, you will need to update this code,
    because the `StreamsMetric` interface was changed.
-   See [Streams API changes in 0.11.0](../streams/upgrade-guide#streams_api_changes_0110)
    and [Streams API changes in 0.10.2](../streams/upgrade-guide#streams_api_changes_0102)
    for more details.

### Upgrading a 0.10.0 Kafka Streams Application {#upgrade_1100_streams_from_0100}

-   Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.0 to 0.11.0 does
    require a [broker upgrade](#upgrade_10_1) because a Kafka Streams
    0.11.0 application can only connect to 0.11.0, 0.10.2, or 0.10.1
    brokers.
-   There are couple of API changes, that are not backward compatible
    (cf. [Streams API changes in 0.11.0](../streams/upgrade-guide#streams_api_changes_0110),
    [Streams API changes in 0.10.2](../streams/upgrade-guide#streams_api_changes_0102),
    and [Streams API changes in 0.10.1](../streams/upgrade-guide#streams_api_changes_0101)
    for more details). Thus, you need to update and recompile your code.
    Just swapping the Kafka Streams library jar file will not work and
    will break your application.
-   Upgrading from 0.10.0.x to 0.11.0.3 requires two rolling bounces
    with config `upgrade.from="0.10.0"` set for first upgrade phase (cf.
    [KIP-268](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-268%3A+Simplify+Kafka+Streams+Rebalance+Metadata+Upgrade)).
    As an alternative, an offline upgrade is also possible.
    -   prepare your application instances for a rolling bounce and make
        sure that config `upgrade.from` is set to `"0.10.0"` for new
        version 0.11.0.3
    -   bounce each instance of your application once
    -   prepare your newly deployed 0.11.0.3 application instances for a
        second round of rolling bounces; make sure to remove the value
        for config `upgrade.from`
    -   bounce each instance of your application once more to complete
        the upgrade
-   Upgrading from 0.10.0.x to 0.11.0.0, 0.11.0.1, or 0.11.0.2 requires
    an offline upgrade (rolling bounce upgrade is not supported)
    -   stop all old (0.10.0.x) application instances
    -   update your code and swap old code and jar file with new code
        and new jar file
    -   restart all new (0.11.0.0 , 0.11.0.1, or 0.11.0.2) application
        instances

### Notable changes in 0.11.0.3 {#upgrade_1103_notable}

-   New Kafka Streams configuration parameter `upgrade.from` added that
    allows rolling bounce upgrade from version 0.10.0.x
-   See the [**Kafka Streams upgrade guide**](../streams/upgrade-guide)
    for details about this new config.

### Notable changes in 0.11.0.0 {#upgrade_1100_notable}

-   Unclean leader election is now disabled by default. The new default
    favors durability over availability. Users who wish to to retain the
    previous behavior should set the broker config
    `unclean.leader.election.enable` to `true`.
-   Producer configs `block.on.buffer.full`, `metadata.fetch.timeout.ms`
    and `timeout.ms` have been removed. They were initially deprecated
    in Kafka 0.9.0.0.
-   The `offsets.topic.replication.factor` broker config is now enforced
    upon auto topic creation. Internal auto topic creation will fail
    with a GROUP_COORDINATOR_NOT_AVAILABLE error until the cluster size
    meets this replication factor requirement.
-   When compressing data with snappy, the producer and broker will use
    the compression scheme\'s default block size (2 x 32 KB) instead of
    1 KB in order to improve the compression ratio. There have been
    reports of data compressed with the smaller block size being 50%
    larger than when compressed with the larger block size. For the
    snappy case, a producer with 5000 partitions will require an
    additional 315 MB of JVM heap.
-   Similarly, when compressing data with gzip, the producer and broker
    will use 8 KB instead of 1 KB as the buffer size. The default for
    gzip is excessively low (512 bytes).
-   The broker configuration `max.message.bytes` now applies to the
    total size of a batch of messages. Previously the setting applied to
    batches of compressed messages, or to non-compressed messages
    individually. A message batch may consist of only a single message,
    so in most cases, the limitation on the size of individual messages
    is only reduced by the overhead of the batch format. However, there
    are some subtle implications for message format conversion (see
    [below](#upgrade_11_message_format) for more detail). Note also that
    while previously the broker would ensure that at least one message
    is returned in each fetch request (regardless of the total and
    partition-level fetch sizes), the same behavior now applies to one
    message batch.
-   GC log rotation is enabled by default, see KAFKA-3754 for details.
-   Deprecated constructors of RecordMetadata, MetricName and Cluster
    classes have been removed.
-   Added user headers support through a new Headers interface providing
    user headers read and write access.
-   ProducerRecord and ConsumerRecord expose the new Headers API via
    `Headers headers()` method call.
-   ExtendedSerializer and ExtendedDeserializer interfaces are
    introduced to support serialization and deserialization for headers.
    Headers will be ignored if the configured serializer and
    deserializer are not the above classes.
-   A new config, `group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms`, was introduced.
    This config specifies the time, in milliseconds, that the
    `GroupCoordinator` will delay the initial consumer rebalance. The
    rebalance will be further delayed by the value of
    `group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms` as new members join the group, up
    to a maximum of `max.poll.interval.ms`. The default value for this
    is 3 seconds. During development and testing it might be desirable
    to set this to 0 in order to not delay test execution time.
-   `org.apache.kafka.common.Cluster#partitionsForTopic`,
    `partitionsForNode` and `availablePartitionsForTopic` methods will
    return an empty list instead of `null` (which is considered a bad
    practice) in case the metadata for the required topic does not
    exist.
-   Streams API configuration parameters `timestamp.extractor`,
    `key.serde`, and `value.serde` were deprecated and replaced by
    `default.timestamp.extractor`, `default.key.serde`, and
    `default.value.serde`, respectively.
-   For offset commit failures in the Java consumer\'s `commitAsync`
    APIs, we no longer expose the underlying cause when instances of
    `RetriableCommitFailedException` are passed to the commit callback.
    See [KAFKA-5052](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-5052)
    for more detail.

### Notes on Exactly Once Semantics {#upgrade_11_exactly_once_semantics}

Kafka 0.11.0 includes support for idempotent and transactional
capabilities in the producer. Idempotent delivery ensures that messages
are delivered exactly once to a particular topic partition during the
lifetime of a single producer. Transactional delivery allows producers
to send data to multiple partitions such that either all messages are
successfully delivered, or none of them are. Together, these
capabilities enable \"exactly once semantics\" in Kafka. More details on
these features are available in the user guide, but below we add a few
specific notes on enabling them in an upgraded cluster. Note that
enabling EoS is not required and there is no impact on the broker\'s
behavior if unused.

1.  Only the new Java producer and consumer support exactly once
    semantics.
2.  These features depend crucially on the [0.11.0 message
    format](#upgrade_11_message_format). Attempting to use them on an
    older format will result in unsupported version errors.
3.  Transaction state is stored in a new internal topic
    `__transaction_state`. This topic is not created until the the first
    attempt to use a transactional request API. Similar to the consumer
    offsets topic, there are several settings to control the topic\'s
    configuration. For example, `transaction.state.log.min.isr` controls
    the minimum ISR for this topic. See the configuration section in the
    user guide for a full list of options.
4.  For secure clusters, the transactional APIs require new ACLs which
    can be turned on with the `bin/kafka-acls.sh`. tool.
5.  EoS in Kafka introduces new request APIs and modifies several
    existing ones. See
    [KIP-98](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-98+-+Exactly+Once+Delivery+and+Transactional+Messaging#KIP-98-ExactlyOnceDeliveryandTransactionalMessaging-RPCProtocolSummary)
    for the full details

### Notes on the new message format in 0.11.0 {#upgrade_11_message_format}

The 0.11.0 message format includes several major enhancements in order
to support better delivery semantics for the producer (see
[KIP-98](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-98+-+Exactly+Once+Delivery+and+Transactional+Messaging))
and improved replication fault tolerance (see
[KIP-101](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-101+-+Alter+Replication+Protocol+to+use+Leader+Epoch+rather+than+High+Watermark+for+Truncation)).
Although the new format contains more information to make these
improvements possible, we have made the batch format much more
efficient. As long as the number of messages per batch is more than 2,
you can expect lower overall overhead. For smaller batches, however,
there may be a small performance impact. See
[here](bit.ly/kafka-eos-perf) for the results of our initial performance
analysis of the new message format. You can also find more detail on the
message format in the
[KIP-98](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-98+-+Exactly+Once+Delivery+and+Transactional+Messaging#KIP-98-ExactlyOnceDeliveryandTransactionalMessaging-MessageFormat)
proposal.

One of the notable differences in the new message format is that even
uncompressed messages are stored together as a single batch. This has a
few implications for the broker configuration `max.message.bytes`, which
limits the size of a single batch. First, if an older client produces
messages to a topic partition using the old format, and the messages are
individually smaller than `max.message.bytes`, the broker may still
reject them after they are merged into a single batch during the
up-conversion process. Generally this can happen when the aggregate size
of the individual messages is larger than `max.message.bytes`. There is
a similar effect for older consumers reading messages down-converted
from the new format: if the fetch size is not set at least as large as
`max.message.bytes`, the consumer may not be able to make progress even
if the individual uncompressed messages are smaller than the configured
fetch size. This behavior does not impact the Java client for 0.10.1.0
and later since it uses an updated fetch protocol which ensures that at
least one message can be returned even if it exceeds the fetch size. To
get around these problems, you should ensure 1) that the producer\'s
batch size is not set larger than `max.message.bytes`, and 2) that the
consumer\'s fetch size is set at least as large as `max.message.bytes`.

Most of the discussion on the performance impact of [upgrading to the
0.10.0 message format](#upgrade_10_performance_impact) remains pertinent
to the 0.11.0 upgrade. This mainly affects clusters that are not secured
with TLS since \"zero-copy\" transfer is already not possible in that
case. In order to avoid the cost of down-conversion, you should ensure
that consumer applications are upgraded to the latest 0.11.0 client.
Significantly, since the old consumer has been deprecated in 0.11.0.0,
it does not support the new message format. You must upgrade to use the
new consumer to use the new message format without the cost of
down-conversion. Note that 0.11.0 consumers support backwards
compatibility with 0.10.0 brokers and upward, so it is possible to
upgrade the clients first before the brokers.

## Upgrading from 0.8.x, 0.9.x, 0.10.0.x or 0.10.1.x to 0.10.2.0 {#upgrade_10_2_0}

0.10.2.0 has wire protocol changes. By following the recommended rolling
upgrade plan below, you guarantee no downtime during the upgrade.
However, please review the [notable changes in
0.10.2.0](#upgrade_1020_notable) before upgrading.

Starting with version 0.10.2, Java clients (producer and consumer) have
acquired the ability to communicate with older brokers. Version 0.10.2
clients can talk to version 0.10.0 or newer brokers. However, if your
brokers are older than 0.10.0, you must upgrade all the brokers in the
Kafka cluster before upgrading your clients. Version 0.10.2 brokers
support 0.8.x and newer clients.

**For a rolling upgrade:**

1.  Update server.properties file on all brokers and add the following
    properties:
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. 0.8.2,
        0.9.0, 0.10.0 or 0.10.1).
    -   log.message.format.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (See [potential
        performance impact following the
        upgrade](#upgrade_10_performance_impact) for the details on what
        this configuration does.)
2.  Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the
    code, and restart it.
3.  Once the entire cluster is upgraded, bump the protocol version by
    editing inter.broker.protocol.version and setting it to 0.10.2.
4.  If your previous message format is 0.10.0, change
    log.message.format.version to 0.10.2 (this is a no-op as the message
    format is the same for 0.10.0, 0.10.1 and 0.10.2). If your previous
    message format version is lower than 0.10.0, do not change
    log.message.format.version yet - this parameter should only change
    once all consumers have been upgraded to 0.10.0.0 or later.
5.  Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take
    effect.
6.  If log.message.format.version is still lower than 0.10.0 at this
    point, wait until all consumers have been upgraded to 0.10.0 or
    later, then change log.message.format.version to 0.10.2 on each
    broker and restart them one by one.

**Note:** If you are willing to accept downtime, you can simply take all
the brokers down, update the code and start all of them. They will start
with the new protocol by default.

**Note:** Bumping the protocol version and restarting can be done any
time after the brokers were upgraded. It does not have to be immediately
after.

### Upgrading a 0.10.1 Kafka Streams Application {#upgrade_1020_streams_from_0101}

-   Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.1 to 0.10.2 does not
    require a broker upgrade. A Kafka Streams 0.10.2 application can
    connect to 0.10.2 and 0.10.1 brokers (it is not possible to connect
    to 0.10.0 brokers though).
-   You need to recompile your code. Just swapping the Kafka Streams
    library jar file will not work and will break your application.
-   If you use a custom (i.e., user implemented) timestamp extractor,
    you will need to update this code, because the `TimestampExtractor`
    interface was changed.
-   If you register custom metrics, you will need to update this code,
    because the `StreamsMetric` interface was changed.
-   See [Streams API changes in 0.10.2](../streams/upgrade-guide#streams_api_changes_0102)
    for more details.

### Upgrading a 0.10.0 Kafka Streams Application {#upgrade_1020_streams_from_0100}

-   Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.0 to 0.10.2 does
    require a [broker upgrade](#upgrade_10_1) because a Kafka Streams
    0.10.2 application can only connect to 0.10.2 or 0.10.1 brokers.
-   There are couple of API changes, that are not backward compatible
    (cf. [Streams API changes in
    0.10.2](/{{< param akVersion >}}/documentation/streams#streams_api_changes_0102)
    for more details). Thus, you need to update and recompile your code.
    Just swapping the Kafka Streams library jar file will not work and
    will break your application.
-   Upgrading from 0.10.0.x to 0.10.2.2 requires two rolling bounces
    with config `upgrade.from="0.10.0"` set for first upgrade phase (cf.
    [KIP-268](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-268%3A+Simplify+Kafka+Streams+Rebalance+Metadata+Upgrade)).
    As an alternative, an offline upgrade is also possible.
    -   prepare your application instances for a rolling bounce and make
        sure that config `upgrade.from` is set to `"0.10.0"` for new
        version 0.10.2.2
    -   bounce each instance of your application once
    -   prepare your newly deployed 0.10.2.2 application instances for a
        second round of rolling bounces; make sure to remove the value
        for config `upgrade.from`
    -   bounce each instance of your application once more to complete
        the upgrade
-   Upgrading from 0.10.0.x to 0.10.2.0 or 0.10.2.1 requires an offline
    upgrade (rolling bounce upgrade is not supported)
    -   stop all old (0.10.0.x) application instances
    -   update your code and swap old code and jar file with new code
        and new jar file
    -   restart all new (0.10.2.0 or 0.10.2.1) application instances

### Notable changes in 0.10.2.2 {#upgrade_10202_notable}

-   New configuration parameter `upgrade.from` added that allows rolling
    bounce upgrade from version 0.10.0.x

### Notable changes in 0.10.2.1 {#upgrade_10201_notable}

-   The default values for two configurations of the StreamsConfig class
    were changed to improve the resiliency of Kafka Streams
    applications. The internal Kafka Streams producer `retries` default
    value was changed from 0 to 10. The internal Kafka Streams consumer
    `max.poll.interval.ms` default value was changed from 300000 to
    `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

### Notable changes in 0.10.2.0 {#upgrade_1020_notable}

-   The Java clients (producer and consumer) have acquired the ability
    to communicate with older brokers. Version 0.10.2 clients can talk
    to version 0.10.0 or newer brokers. Note that some features are not
    available or are limited when older brokers are used.
-   Several methods on the Java consumer may now throw
    `InterruptException` if the calling thread is interrupted. Please
    refer to the `KafkaConsumer` Javadoc for a more in-depth explanation
    of this change.
-   Java consumer now shuts down gracefully. By default, the consumer
    waits up to 30 seconds to complete pending requests. A new close API
    with timeout has been added to `KafkaConsumer` to control the
    maximum wait time.
-   Multiple regular expressions separated by commas can be passed to
    MirrorMaker with the new Java consumer via the \--whitelist option.
    This makes the behaviour consistent with MirrorMaker when used the
    old Scala consumer.
-   Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.1 to 0.10.2 does not
    require a broker upgrade. A Kafka Streams 0.10.2 application can
    connect to 0.10.2 and 0.10.1 brokers (it is not possible to connect
    to 0.10.0 brokers though).
-   The Zookeeper dependency was removed from the Streams API. The
    Streams API now uses the Kafka protocol to manage internal topics
    instead of modifying Zookeeper directly. This eliminates the need
    for privileges to access Zookeeper directly and
    \"StreamsConfig.ZOOKEEPER_CONFIG\" should not be set in the Streams
    app any more. If the Kafka cluster is secured, Streams apps must
    have the required security privileges to create new topics.
-   Several new fields including \"security.protocol\",
    \"connections.max.idle.ms\", \"retry.backoff.ms\",
    \"reconnect.backoff.ms\" and \"request.timeout.ms\" were added to
    StreamsConfig class. User should pay attention to the default values
    and set these if needed. For more details please refer to [3.5 Kafka Streams Configs](/{{< param akVersion >}}/documentation/#streamsconfigs).

### New Protocol Versions {#upgrade_1020_new_protocols}

-   [KIP-88](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-88%3A+OffsetFetch+Protocol+Update):
    OffsetFetchRequest v2 supports retrieval of offsets for all topics
    if the `topics` array is set to `null`.
-   [KIP-88](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-88%3A+OffsetFetch+Protocol+Update):
    OffsetFetchResponse v2 introduces a top-level `error_code` field.
-   [KIP-103](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-103%3A+Separation+of+Internal+and+External+traffic):
    UpdateMetadataRequest v3 introduces a `listener_name` field to the
    elements of the `end_points` array.
-   [KIP-108](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-108%3A+Create+Topic+Policy):
    CreateTopicsRequest v1 introduces a `validate_only` field.
-   [KIP-108](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-108%3A+Create+Topic+Policy):
    CreateTopicsResponse v1 introduces an `error_message` field to the
    elements of the `topic_errors` array.

## Upgrading from 0.8.x, 0.9.x or 0.10.0.X to 0.10.1.0 {#upgrade_10_1}

0.10.1.0 has wire protocol changes. By following the recommended rolling
upgrade plan below, you guarantee no downtime during the upgrade.
However, please notice the [Potential breaking changes in
0.10.1.0](#upgrade_10_1_breaking) before upgrade.\
Note: Because new protocols are introduced, it is important to upgrade
your Kafka clusters before upgrading your clients (i.e. 0.10.1.x clients
only support 0.10.1.x or later brokers while 0.10.1.x brokers also
support older clients).

**For a rolling upgrade:**

1.  Update server.properties file on all brokers and add the following
    properties:
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g.
        0.8.2.0, 0.9.0.0 or 0.10.0.0).
    -   log.message.format.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (See [potential
        performance impact following the
        upgrade](#upgrade_10_performance_impact) for the details on what
        this configuration does.)
2.  Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the
    code, and restart it.
3.  Once the entire cluster is upgraded, bump the protocol version by
    editing inter.broker.protocol.version and setting it to 0.10.1.0.
4.  If your previous message format is 0.10.0, change
    log.message.format.version to 0.10.1 (this is a no-op as the message
    format is the same for both 0.10.0 and 0.10.1). If your previous
    message format version is lower than 0.10.0, do not change
    log.message.format.version yet - this parameter should only change
    once all consumers have been upgraded to 0.10.0.0 or later.
5.  Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take
    effect.
6.  If log.message.format.version is still lower than 0.10.0 at this
    point, wait until all consumers have been upgraded to 0.10.0 or
    later, then change log.message.format.version to 0.10.1 on each
    broker and restart them one by one.

**Note:** If you are willing to accept downtime, you can simply take all
the brokers down, update the code and start all of them. They will start
with the new protocol by default.

**Note:** Bumping the protocol version and restarting can be done any
time after the brokers were upgraded. It does not have to be immediately
after.

### Potential breaking changes in 0.10.1.0 {#upgrade_10_1_breaking}

-   The log retention time is no longer based on last modified time of
    the log segments. Instead it will be based on the largest timestamp
    of the messages in a log segment.
-   The log rolling time is no longer depending on log segment create
    time. Instead it is now based on the timestamp in the messages. More
    specifically. if the timestamp of the first message in the segment
    is T, the log will be rolled out when a new message has a timestamp
    greater than or equal to T + log.roll.ms
-   The open file handlers of 0.10.0 will increase by \~33% because of
    the addition of time index files for each segment.
-   The time index and offset index share the same index size
    configuration. Since each time index entry is 1.5x the size of
    offset index entry. User may need to increase
    log.index.size.max.bytes to avoid potential frequent log rolling.
-   Due to the increased number of index files, on some brokers with
    large amount the log segments (e.g. \>15K), the log loading process
    during the broker startup could be longer. Based on our experiment,
    setting the num.recovery.threads.per.data.dir to one may reduce the

### Upgrading a 0.10.0 Kafka Streams Application {#upgrade_1010_streams_from_0100}

-   Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.0 to 0.10.1 does
    require a [broker upgrade](#upgrade_10_1) because a Kafka Streams
    0.10.1 application can only connect to 0.10.1 brokers.
-   There are couple of API changes, that are not backward compatible
    (cf. [Streams API changes in
    0.10.1](../streams/upgrade-guide#streams_api_changes_0101)
    for more details). Thus, you need to update and recompile your code.
    Just swapping the Kafka Streams library jar file will not work and
    will break your application.
-   Upgrading from 0.10.0.x to 0.10.1.2 requires two rolling bounces
    with config `upgrade.from="0.10.0"` set for first upgrade phase (cf.
    [KIP-268](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-268%3A+Simplify+Kafka+Streams+Rebalance+Metadata+Upgrade)).
    As an alternative, an offline upgrade is also possible.
    -   prepare your application instances for a rolling bounce and make
        sure that config `upgrade.from` is set to `"0.10.0"` for new
        version 0.10.1.2
    -   bounce each instance of your application once
    -   prepare your newly deployed 0.10.1.2 application instances for a
        second round of rolling bounces; make sure to remove the value
        for config `upgrade.from`
    -   bounce each instance of your application once more to complete
        the upgrade
-   Upgrading from 0.10.0.x to 0.10.1.0 or 0.10.1.1 requires an offline
    upgrade (rolling bounce upgrade is not supported)
    -   stop all old (0.10.0.x) application instances
    -   update your code and swap old code and jar file with new code
        and new jar file
    -   restart all new (0.10.1.0 or 0.10.1.1) application instances

### Notable changes in 0.10.1.0 {#upgrade_1010_notable}

-   The new Java consumer is no longer in beta and we recommend it for
    all new development. The old Scala consumers are still supported,
    but they will be deprecated in the next release and will be removed
    in a future major release.
-   The `--new-consumer`/`--new.consumer` switch is no longer required
    to use tools like MirrorMaker and the Console Consumer with the new
    consumer; one simply needs to pass a Kafka broker to connect to
    instead of the ZooKeeper ensemble. In addition, usage of the Console
    Consumer with the old consumer has been deprecated and it will be
    removed in a future major release.
-   Kafka clusters can now be uniquely identified by a cluster id. It
    will be automatically generated when a broker is upgraded to
    0.10.1.0. The cluster id is available via the
    kafka.server:type=KafkaServer,name=ClusterId metric and it is part
    of the Metadata response. Serializers, client interceptors and
    metric reporters can receive the cluster id by implementing the
    ClusterResourceListener interface.
-   The BrokerState \"RunningAsController\" (value 4) has been removed.
    Due to a bug, a broker would only be in this state briefly before
    transitioning out of it and hence the impact of the removal should
    be minimal. The recommended way to detect if a given broker is the
    controller is via the
    kafka.controller:type=KafkaController,name=ActiveControllerCount
    metric.
-   The new Java Consumer now allows users to search offsets by
    timestamp on partitions.
-   The new Java Consumer now supports heartbeating from a background
    thread. There is a new configuration `max.poll.interval.ms` which
    controls the maximum time between poll invocations before the
    consumer will proactively leave the group (5 minutes by default).
    The value of the configuration `request.timeout.ms` (default to 30
    seconds) must always be smaller than `max.poll.interval.ms`(default
    to 5 minutes), since that is the maximum time that a JoinGroup
    request can block on the server while the consumer is rebalance.
    Finally, the default value of `session.timeout.ms` has been adjusted
    down to 10 seconds, and the default value of `max.poll.records` has
    been changed to 500.
-   When using an Authorizer and a user doesn\'t have **Describe**
    authorization on a topic, the broker will no longer return
    TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED errors to requests since this leaks topic
    names. Instead, the UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION error code will be
    returned. This may cause unexpected timeouts or delays when using
    the producer and consumer since Kafka clients will typically retry
    automatically on unknown topic errors. You should consult the client
    logs if you suspect this could be happening.
-   Fetch responses have a size limit by default (50 MB for consumers
    and 10 MB for replication). The existing per partition limits also
    apply (1 MB for consumers and replication). Note that neither of
    these limits is an absolute maximum as explained in the next point.
-   Consumers and replicas can make progress if a message larger than
    the response/partition size limit is found. More concretely, if the
    first message in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is
    larger than either or both limits, the message will still be
    returned.
-   Overloaded constructors were added to `kafka.api.FetchRequest` and
    `kafka.javaapi.FetchRequest` to allow the caller to specify the
    order of the partitions (since order is significant in v3). The
    previously existing constructors were deprecated and the partitions
    are shuffled before the request is sent to avoid starvation issues.

### New Protocol Versions {#upgrade_1010_new_protocols}

-   ListOffsetRequest v1 supports accurate offset search based on
    timestamps.
-   MetadataResponse v2 introduces a new field: \"cluster_id\".
-   FetchRequest v3 supports limiting the response size (in addition to
    the existing per partition limit), it returns messages bigger than
    the limits if required to make progress and the order of partitions
    in the request is now significant.
-   JoinGroup v1 introduces a new field: \"rebalance_timeout\".

## Upgrading from 0.8.x or 0.9.x to 0.10.0.0 {#upgrade_10}

0.10.0.0 has [potential breaking changes](#upgrade_10_breaking) (please
review before upgrading) and possible [performance impact following the
upgrade](#upgrade_10_performance_impact). By following the recommended
rolling upgrade plan below, you guarantee no downtime and no performance
impact during and following the upgrade.\
Note: Because new protocols are introduced, it is important to upgrade
your Kafka clusters before upgrading your clients.

**Notes to clients with version 0.9.0.0:** Due to a bug introduced in
0.9.0.0, clients that depend on ZooKeeper (old Scala high-level Consumer
and MirrorMaker if used with the old consumer) will not work with
0.10.0.x brokers. Therefore, 0.9.0.0 clients should be upgraded to
0.9.0.1 **before** brokers are upgraded to 0.10.0.x. This step is not
necessary for 0.8.X or 0.9.0.1 clients.

**For a rolling upgrade:**

1.  Update server.properties file on all brokers and add the following
    properties:
    -   inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. 0.8.2
        or 0.9.0.0).
    -   log.message.format.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (See [potential
        performance impact following the
        upgrade](#upgrade_10_performance_impact) for the details on what
        this configuration does.)
2.  Upgrade the brokers. This can be done a broker at a time by simply
    bringing it down, updating the code, and restarting it.
3.  Once the entire cluster is upgraded, bump the protocol version by
    editing inter.broker.protocol.version and setting it to 0.10.0.0.
    NOTE: You shouldn\'t touch log.message.format.version yet - this
    parameter should only change once all consumers have been upgraded
    to 0.10.0.0
4.  Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take
    effect.
5.  Once all consumers have been upgraded to 0.10.0, change
    log.message.format.version to 0.10.0 on each broker and restart them
    one by one.

**Note:** If you are willing to accept downtime, you can simply take all
the brokers down, update the code and start all of them. They will start
with the new protocol by default.

**Note:** Bumping the protocol version and restarting can be done any
time after the brokers were upgraded. It does not have to be immediately
after.

### Potential performance impact following upgrade to 0.10.0.0 {#upgrade_10_performance_impact}

The message format in 0.10.0 includes a new timestamp field and uses
relative offsets for compressed messages. The on disk message format can
be configured through log.message.format.version in the
server.properties file. The default on-disk message format is 0.10.0. If
a consumer client is on a version before 0.10.0.0, it only understands
message formats before 0.10.0. In this case, the broker is able to
convert messages from the 0.10.0 format to an earlier format before
sending the response to the consumer on an older version. However, the
broker can\'t use zero-copy transfer in this case. Reports from the
Kafka community on the performance impact have shown CPU utilization
going from 20% before to 100% after an upgrade, which forced an
immediate upgrade of all clients to bring performance back to normal. To
avoid such message conversion before consumers are upgraded to 0.10.0.0,
one can set log.message.format.version to 0.8.2 or 0.9.0 when upgrading
the broker to 0.10.0.0. This way, the broker can still use zero-copy
transfer to send the data to the old consumers. Once consumers are
upgraded, one can change the message format to 0.10.0 on the broker and
enjoy the new message format that includes new timestamp and improved
compression. The conversion is supported to ensure compatibility and can
be useful to support a few apps that have not updated to newer clients
yet, but is impractical to support all consumer traffic on even an
over-provisioned cluster. Therefore, it is critical to avoid the message
conversion as much as possible when brokers have been upgraded but the
majority of clients have not.

For clients that are upgraded to 0.10.0.0, there is no performance
impact.

**Note:** By setting the message format version, one certifies that all
existing messages are on or below that message format version. Otherwise
consumers before 0.10.0.0 might break. In particular, after the message
format is set to 0.10.0, one should not change it back to an earlier
format as it may break consumers on versions before 0.10.0.0.

**Note:** Due to the additional timestamp introduced in each message,
producers sending small messages may see a message throughput
degradation because of the increased overhead. Likewise, replication now
transmits an additional 8 bytes per message. If you\'re running close to
the network capacity of your cluster, it\'s possible that you\'ll
overwhelm the network cards and see failures and performance issues due
to the overload.

**Note:** If you have enabled compression on producers, you may notice
reduced producer throughput and/or lower compression rate on the broker
in some cases. When receiving compressed messages, 0.10.0 brokers avoid
recompressing the messages, which in general reduces the latency and
improves the throughput. In certain cases, however, this may reduce the
batching size on the producer, which could lead to worse throughput. If
this happens, users can tune linger.ms and batch.size of the producer
for better throughput. In addition, the producer buffer used for
compressing messages with snappy is smaller than the one used by the
broker, which may have a negative impact on the compression ratio for
the messages on disk. We intend to make this configurable in a future
Kafka release.

### Potential breaking changes in 0.10.0.0 {#upgrade_10_breaking}

-   Starting from Kafka 0.10.0.0, the message format version in Kafka is
    represented as the Kafka version. For example, message format 0.9.0
    refers to the highest message version supported by Kafka 0.9.0.
-   Message format 0.10.0 has been introduced and it is used by default.
    It includes a timestamp field in the messages and relative offsets
    are used for compressed messages.
-   ProduceRequest/Response v2 has been introduced and it is used by
    default to support message format 0.10.0
-   FetchRequest/Response v2 has been introduced and it is used by
    default to support message format 0.10.0
-   MessageFormatter interface was changed from
    `def writeTo(key: Array[Byte], value: Array[Byte], output: PrintStream)`
    to
    `def writeTo(consumerRecord: ConsumerRecord[Array[Byte], Array[Byte]], output: PrintStream)`
-   MessageReader interface was changed from
    `def readMessage(): KeyedMessage[Array[Byte], Array[Byte]]` to
    `def readMessage(): ProducerRecord[Array[Byte], Array[Byte]]`
-   MessageFormatter\'s package was changed from `kafka.tools` to
    `kafka.common`
-   MessageReader\'s package was changed from `kafka.tools` to
    `kafka.common`
-   MirrorMakerMessageHandler no longer exposes the
    `handle(record: MessageAndMetadata[Array[Byte], Array[Byte]])`
    method as it was never called.
-   The 0.7 KafkaMigrationTool is no longer packaged with Kafka. If you
    need to migrate from 0.7 to 0.10.0, please migrate to 0.8 first and
    then follow the documented upgrade process to upgrade from 0.8 to
    0.10.0.
-   The new consumer has standardized its APIs to accept
    `java.util.Collection` as the sequence type for method parameters.
    Existing code may have to be updated to work with the 0.10.0 client
    library.
-   LZ4-compressed message handling was changed to use an interoperable
    framing specification (LZ4f v1.5.1). To maintain compatibility with
    old clients, this change only applies to Message format 0.10.0 and
    later. Clients that Produce/Fetch LZ4-compressed messages using
    v0/v1 (Message format 0.9.0) should continue to use the 0.9.0
    framing implementation. Clients that use Produce/Fetch protocols v2
    or later should use interoperable LZ4f framing. A list of
    interoperable LZ4 libraries is available at <https://www.lz4.org/>

### Notable changes in 0.10.0.0 {#upgrade_10_notable}

-   Starting from Kafka 0.10.0.0, a new client library named **Kafka
    Streams** is available for stream processing on data stored in Kafka
    topics. This new client library only works with 0.10.x and upward
    versioned brokers due to message format changes mentioned above. For
    more information please read [Streams documentation](../streams).
-   The default value of the configuration parameter
    `receive.buffer.bytes` is now 64K for the new consumer.
-   The new consumer now exposes the configuration parameter
    `exclude.internal.topics` to restrict internal topics (such as the
    consumer offsets topic) from accidentally being included in regular
    expression subscriptions. By default, it is enabled.
-   The old Scala producer has been deprecated. Users should migrate
    their code to the Java producer included in the kafka-clients JAR as
    soon as possible.
-   The new consumer API has been marked stable.

## Upgrading from 0.8.0, 0.8.1.X, or 0.8.2.X to 0.9.0.0 {#upgrade_9}

0.9.0.0 has [potential breaking changes](#upgrade_9_breaking) (please
review before upgrading) and an inter-broker protocol change from
previous versions. This means that upgraded brokers and clients may not
be compatible with older versions. It is important that you upgrade your
Kafka cluster before upgrading your clients. If you are using
MirrorMaker downstream clusters should be upgraded first as well.

**For a rolling upgrade:**

1.  Update server.properties file on all brokers and add the following
    property: inter.broker.protocol.version=0.8.2.X
2.  Upgrade the brokers. This can be done a broker at a time by simply
    bringing it down, updating the code, and restarting it.
3.  Once the entire cluster is upgraded, bump the protocol version by
    editing inter.broker.protocol.version and setting it to 0.9.0.0.
4.  Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take
    effect

**Note:** If you are willing to accept downtime, you can simply take all
the brokers down, update the code and start all of them. They will start
with the new protocol by default.

**Note:** Bumping the protocol version and restarting can be done any
time after the brokers were upgraded. It does not have to be immediately
after.

### Potential breaking changes in 0.9.0.0 {#upgrade_9_breaking}

-   Java 1.6 is no longer supported.
-   Scala 2.9 is no longer supported.
-   Broker IDs above 1000 are now reserved by default to automatically
    assigned broker IDs. If your cluster has existing broker IDs above
    that threshold make sure to increase the reserved.broker.max.id
    broker configuration property accordingly.
-   Configuration parameter replica.lag.max.messages was removed.
    Partition leaders will no longer consider the number of lagging
    messages when deciding which replicas are in sync.
-   Configuration parameter replica.lag.time.max.ms now refers not just
    to the time passed since last fetch request from replica, but also
    to time since the replica last caught up. Replicas that are still
    fetching messages from leaders but did not catch up to the latest
    messages in replica.lag.time.max.ms will be considered out of sync.
-   Compacted topics no longer accept messages without key and an
    exception is thrown by the producer if this is attempted. In 0.8.x,
    a message without key would cause the log compaction thread to
    subsequently complain and quit (and stop compacting all compacted
    topics).
-   MirrorMaker no longer supports multiple target clusters. As a result
    it will only accept a single \--consumer.config parameter. To mirror
    multiple source clusters, you will need at least one MirrorMaker
    instance per source cluster, each with its own consumer
    configuration.
-   Tools packaged under *org.apache.kafka.clients.tools.\** have been
    moved to *org.apache.kafka.tools.\**. All included scripts will
    still function as usual, only custom code directly importing these
    classes will be affected.
-   The default Kafka JVM performance options
    (KAFKA_JVM_PERFORMANCE_OPTS) have been changed in
    kafka-run-class.sh.
-   The kafka-topics.sh script (kafka.admin.TopicCommand) now exits with
    non-zero exit code on failure.
-   The kafka-topics.sh script (kafka.admin.TopicCommand) will now print
    a warning when topic names risk metric collisions due to the use of
    a \'.\' or \'\_\' in the topic name, and error in the case of an
    actual collision.
-   The kafka-console-producer.sh script (kafka.tools.ConsoleProducer)
    will use the Java producer instead of the old Scala producer be
    default, and users have to specify \'old-producer\' to use the old
    producer.
-   By default, all command line tools will print all logging messages
    to stderr instead of stdout.

### Notable changes in 0.9.0.1 {#upgrade_901_notable}

-   The new broker id generation feature can be disabled by setting
    broker.id.generation.enable to false.
-   Configuration parameter log.cleaner.enable is now true by default.
    This means topics with a cleanup.policy=compact will now be
    compacted by default, and 128 MB of heap will be allocated to the
    cleaner process via log.cleaner.dedupe.buffer.size. You may want to
    review log.cleaner.dedupe.buffer.size and the other log.cleaner
    configuration values based on your usage of compacted topics.
-   Default value of configuration parameter fetch.min.bytes for the new
    consumer is now 1 by default.

### Deprecations in 0.9.0.0

-   Altering topic configuration from the kafka-topics.sh script
    (kafka.admin.TopicCommand) has been deprecated. Going forward,
    please use the kafka-configs.sh script (kafka.admin.ConfigCommand)
    for this functionality.
-   The kafka-consumer-offset-checker.sh
    (kafka.tools.ConsumerOffsetChecker) has been deprecated. Going
    forward, please use kafka-consumer-groups.sh
    (kafka.admin.ConsumerGroupCommand) for this functionality.
-   The kafka.tools.ProducerPerformance class has been deprecated. Going
    forward, please use org.apache.kafka.tools.ProducerPerformance for
    this functionality (kafka-producer-perf-test.sh will also be changed
    to use the new class).
-   The producer config block.on.buffer.full has been deprecated and
    will be removed in future release. Currently its default value has
    been changed to false. The KafkaProducer will no longer throw
    BufferExhaustedException but instead will use max.block.ms value to
    block, after which it will throw a TimeoutException. If
    block.on.buffer.full property is set to true explicitly, it will set
    the max.block.ms to Long.MAX_VALUE and metadata.fetch.timeout.ms
    will not be honoured

## Upgrading from 0.8.1 to 0.8.2 {#upgrade_82}

0.8.2 is fully compatible with 0.8.1. The upgrade can be done one broker
at a time by simply bringing it down, updating the code, and restarting
it.

## Upgrading from 0.8.0 to 0.8.1 {#upgrade_81}

0.8.1 is fully compatible with 0.8. The upgrade can be done one broker
at a time by simply bringing it down, updating the code, and restarting
it.

## Upgrading from 0.7 {#upgrade_7}

Release 0.7 is incompatible with newer releases. Major changes were made
to the API, ZooKeeper data structures, and protocol, and configuration
in order to add replication (Which was missing in 0.7). The upgrade from
0.7 to later versions requires a 
[special tool](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Migrating+from+0.7+to+0.8)
for migration. This migration can be done without downtime.
