    <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_overview" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_overview">7.1 Security Overview</a></h3>
    In release 0.9.0.0, the Kafka community added a number of features that, used either separately or together, increases security in a Kafka cluster. The following security measures are currently supported:
    <ol>
        <li>Authentication of connections to brokers from clients (producers and consumers), other brokers and tools, using either SSL or SASL. Kafka supports the following SASL mechanisms:
        <ul>
            <li>SASL/GSSAPI (Kerberos) - starting at version 0.9.0.0</li>
            <li>SASL/PLAIN - starting at version 0.10.0.0</li>
            <li>SASL/SCRAM-SHA-256 and SASL/SCRAM-SHA-512 - starting at version 0.10.2.0</li>
            <li>SASL/OAUTHBEARER - starting at version 2.0</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Authentication of connections from brokers to ZooKeeper</li>
        <li>Encryption of data transferred between brokers and clients, between brokers, or between brokers and tools using SSL (Note that there is a performance degradation when SSL is enabled, the magnitude of which depends on the CPU type and the JVM implementation.)</li>
        <li>Authorization of read / write operations by clients</li>
        <li>Authorization is pluggable and integration with external authorization services is supported</li>
    </ol>

    It's worth noting that security is optional - non-secured clusters are supported, as well as a mix of authenticated, unauthenticated, encrypted and non-encrypted clients.

    The guides below explain how to configure and use the security features in both clients and brokers.

    <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_ssl" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_ssl">7.2 Encryption and Authentication using SSL</a></h3>
    Apache Kafka allows clients to use SSL for encryption of traffic as well as authentication. By default, SSL is disabled but can be turned on if needed.
    The following paragraphs explain in detail how to set up your own PKI infrastructure, use it to create certificates and configure Kafka to use these.

    <ol>
        <li><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_ssl_key" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_ssl_key">Generate SSL key and certificate for each Kafka broker</a></h4>
            The first step of deploying one or more brokers with SSL support is to generate a public/private keypair for every server.
            Since Kafka expects all keys and certificates to be stored in keystores we will use Java's keytool command for this task.
            The tool supports two different keystore formats, the Java specific jks format which has been deprecated by now, as well as PKCS12.
            PKCS12 is the default format as of Java version 9, to ensure this format is being used regardless of the Java version in use all following
            commands explicitly specify the PKCS12 format.
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">                keytool -keystore {keystorefile} -alias localhost -validity {validity} -genkey -keyalg RSA -storetype pkcs12</code></pre>
            You need to specify two parameters in the above command:
            <ol>
                <li>keystorefile: the keystore file that stores the keys (and later the certificate) for this broker. The keystore file contains the private
                    and public keys of this broker, therefore it needs to be kept safe. Ideally this step is run on the Kafka broker that the key will be
                    used on, as this key should never be transmitted/leave the server that it is intended for.</li>
                <li>validity: the valid time of the key in days. Please note that this differs from the validity period for the certificate, which
                    will be determined in <a href ="#security_ssl_signing">Signing the certificate</a>. You can use the same key to request multiple
                    certificates: if your key has a validity of 10 years, but your CA will only sign certificates that are valid for one year, you
                    can use the same key with 10 certificates over time.</li>
            </ol><br>
            To obtain a certificate that can be used with the private key that was just created a certificate signing request needs to be created. This
            signing request, when signed by a trusted CA results in the actual certificate which can then be installed in the keystore and used for
            authentication purposes.<br>
            To generate certificate signing requests run the following command for all server keystores created so far.

            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">                keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -validity {validity} -genkey -keyalg RSA -destkeystoretype pkcs12 -ext SAN=DNS:{FQDN},IP:{IPADDRESS1}</code></pre>
            This command assumes that you want to add hostname information to the certificate, if this is not the case, you can omit the extension parameter <code>-ext SAN=DNS:{FQDN},IP:{IPADDRESS1}</code>. Please see below for more information on this.

            <h5>Host Name Verification</h5>
            Host name verification, when enabled, is the process of checking attributes from the certificate that is presented by the server you are
            connecting to against the actual hostname or ip address of that server to ensure that you are indeed connecting to the correct server.<br>
            The main reason for this check is to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

            For Kafka, this check has been disabled by default for a long time, but as of Kafka 2.0.0 host name verification of servers is enabled by default
            for client connections as well as inter-broker connections.<br>
            Server host name verification may be disabled by setting <code>ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm</code> to an empty string.<br>
            For dynamically configured broker listeners, hostname verification may be disabled using <code>kafka-configs.sh</code>:<br>

            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">                bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9093 --entity-type brokers --entity-name 0 --alter --add-config "listener.name.internal.ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm="</code></pre>

            <p><b>Note:</b></p>
            Normally there is no good reason to disable hostname verification apart from being the quickest way to "just get it to work" followed
            by the promise to "fix it later when there is more time"!<br>
            Getting hostname verification right is not that hard when done at the right time, but gets much harder once the cluster is up and
            running - do yourself a favor and do it now!


            <p>If host name verification is enabled, clients will verify the server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or ip address against one of the following two fields:
            <ol>
                <li>Common Name (CN)</li>
                <li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.6">Subject Alternative Name (SAN)</a></li>
            </ol><br>
            While Kafka checks both fields, usage of the common name field for hostname verification has been
            <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818#section-3.1">deprecated</a> since 2000 and should be avoided if possible. In addition the
            SAN field is much more flexible, allowing for multiple DNS and IP entries to be declared in a certificate.<br>
            Another advantage is that if the SAN field is used for hostname verification the common name can be set to a more meaningful value for
            authorization purposes. Since we need the SAN field to be contained in the signed certificate, it will be specified when generating the
            signing request. It can also be specified when generating the keypair, but this will not automatically be copied into the signing request.<br>


            To add a SAN field append the following argument <code> -ext SAN=DNS:{FQDN},IP:{IPADDRESS} </code> to the keytool command:
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">                keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -validity {validity} -genkey -keyalg RSA -destkeystoretype pkcs12 -ext SAN=DNS:{FQDN},IP:{IPADDRESS1}</code></pre>
        </li>

        <li><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_ssl_ca" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_ssl_ca">Creating your own CA</a></h4>
            After this step each machine in the cluster has a public/private key pair which can already be used to encrypt traffic and a certificate
            signing request, which is the basis for creating a certificate. To add authentication capabilities this signing request needs to be signed
            by a trusted authority, which will be created in this step.

            <p>A certificate authority (CA) is responsible for signing certificates. CAs works likes a government that issues passports - the government
            stamps (signs) each passport so that the passport becomes difficult to forge. Other governments verify the stamps to ensure the passport is
            authentic. Similarly, the CA signs the certificates, and the cryptography guarantees that a signed certificate is computationally difficult to
            forge. Thus, as long as the CA is a genuine and trusted authority, the clients have a strong assurance that they are connecting to the authentic
            machines.

            <p>For this guide we will be our own Certificate Authority. When setting up a production cluster in a corporate environment these certificates would
            usually be signed by a corporate CA that is trusted throughout the company. Please see <a href="#security_ssl_production">Common Pitfalls in
            Production</a> for some things to consider for this case.

            <p>Due to a <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/x509.html#BUGS">bug</a> in OpenSSL, the x509 module will not copy requested
            extension fields from CSRs into the final certificate. Since we want the SAN extension to be present in our certificate to enable hostname
            verification, we'll use the <i>ca</i> module instead. This requires some additional configuration to be in place before we generate our
            CA keypair.<br>

            Save the following listing into a file called openssl-ca.cnf and adjust the values for validity and common attributes as necessary.

            Then create a database and serial number file, these will be used to keep track of which certificates were signed with this CA. Both of
            these are simply text files that reside in the same directory as your CA keys.

            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">                echo 01 > serial.txt
                touch index.txt</code></pre>

            With these steps done you are now ready to generate your CA that will be used to sign certificates later.

            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">            openssl req -x509 -config openssl-ca.cnf -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -nodes -out cacert.pem -outform PEM</code></pre>

            The CA is simply a public/private key pair and certificate that is signed by itself, and is only intended to sign other certificates.<br>
            This keypair should be kept very safe, if someone gains access to it, they can create and sign certificates that will be trusted by your
            infrastructure, which means they will be able to impersonate anybody when connecting to any service that trusts this CA.<br>

            The next step is to add the generated CA to the **clients' truststore** so that the clients can trust this CA:
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">                keytool -keystore client.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert</code></pre>

            <b>Note:</b>
            If you configure the Kafka brokers to require client authentication by setting ssl.client.auth to be "requested" or "required" in the
            <a href="#brokerconfigs">Kafka brokers config</a> then you must provide a truststore for the Kafka brokers as well and it should have
            all the CA certificates that clients' keys were signed by.
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">                keytool -keystore server.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert</code></pre>

            In contrast to the keystore in step 1 that stores each machine's own identity, the truststore of a client stores all the certificates
            that the client should trust. Importing a certificate into one's truststore also means trusting all certificates that are signed by that
            certificate. As the analogy above, trusting the government (CA) also means trusting all passports (certificates) that it has issued. This
            attribute is called the chain of trust, and it is particularly useful when deploying SSL on a large Kafka cluster. You can sign all certificates
            in the cluster with a single CA, and have all machines share the same truststore that trusts the CA. That way all machines can authenticate all
            other machines.
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_ssl_signing" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_ssl_signing">Signing the certificate</a></h4>
            Then sign it with the CA:
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">                openssl ca -config openssl-ca.cnf -policy signing_policy -extensions signing_req -out {server certificate} -infiles {certificate signing request}</code></pre>

            Finally, you need to import both the certificate of the CA and the signed certificate into the keystore:
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">                keytool -keystore {keystore} -alias CARoot -import -file {CA certificate}
                keytool -keystore {keystore} -alias localhost -import -file cert-signed</code></pre>

            The definitions of the parameters are the following:
            <ol>
                <li>keystore: the location of the keystore</li>
                <li>CA certificate: the certificate of the CA</li>
                <li>certificate signing request: the csr created with the server key</li>
                <li>server certificate: the file to write the signed certificate of the server to</li>
            </ol>

            This will leave you with one truststore called <i>truststore.jks</i> - this can be the same for all clients and brokers and does not
            contain any sensitive information, so there is no need to secure this.<br>
            Additionally you will have one <i>server.keystore.jks</i> file per node which contains that nodes keys, certificate and your CAs certificate,
            please refer to <a href="#security_configbroker">Configuring Kafka Brokers</a> and <a href="#security_configclients">Configuring Kafka Clients</a>
            for information on how to use these files.

            <p>For some tooling assistance on this topic, please check out the <a href="https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa">easyRSA</a> project which has
                extensive scripting in place to help with these steps.</p>

            <h5>SSL key and certificates in PEM format</h5>
            From 2.7.0 onwards, SSL key and trust stores can be configured for Kafka brokers and clients directly in the configuration in PEM format.
            This avoids the need to store separate files on the file system and benefits from password protection features of Kafka configuration.
            PEM may also be used as the store type for file-based key and trust stores in addition to JKS and PKCS12. To configure PEM key store directly in the
            broker or client configuration, private key in PEM format should be provided in <code>ssl.keystore.key</code> and the certificate chain in PEM format
            should be provided in <code>ssl.keystore.certificate.chain</code>.  To configure trust store, trust certificates, e.g. public certificate of CA,
            should be provided in <code>ssl.truststore.certificates</code>. Since PEM is typically stored as multi-line base-64 strings, the configuration value
            can be included in Kafka configuration as multi-line strings with lines terminating in backslash ('\') for line continuation.

            <p>Store password configs <code>ssl.keystore.password</code> and <code>ssl.truststore.password</code> are not used for PEM.
            If private key is encrypted using a password, the key password must be provided in <code>ssl.key.password</code>. Private keys may be provided
            in unencrypted form without a password when PEM is specified directly in the config value. In production deployments, configs should be encrypted or
            externalized using password protection feature in Kafka in this case. Note that the default SSL engine factory has limited capabilities for decryption
            of encrypted private keys when external tools like OpenSSL are used for encryption. Third party libraries like BouncyCastle may be integrated witn a
            custom <code>SslEngineFactory</code> to support a wider range of encrypted private keys.</p>

        </li>
        <li><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_ssl_production" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_ssl_production">Common Pitfalls in Production</a></h4>
            The above paragraphs show the process to create your own CA and use it to sign certificates for your cluster.
            While very useful for sandbox, dev, test, and similar systems, this is usually not the correct process to create certificates for a production
            cluster in a corporate environment.
            Enterprises will normally operate their own CA and users can send in CSRs to be signed with this CA, which has the benefit of users not being
            responsible to keep the CA secure as well as a central authority that everybody can trust.
            However it also takes away a lot of control over the process of signing certificates from the user. Quite often the persons operating corporate
            CAs will apply tight restrictions on certificates that can cause issues when trying to use these certificates with Kafka.

            <ol>
                <li><b><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12">Extended Key Usage</a></b><br>Certificates may contain an extension
                    field that controls the purpose for which the certificate can be used. If this field is empty, there are no restricitions on the usage,
                    but if any usage is specified in here, valid SSL implementations have to enforce these usages.<br>
                    Relevant usages for Kafka are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Client authentication</li>
                        <li>Server authentication</li>
                    </ul>
                    Kafka brokers need both these usages to be allowed, as for intra-cluster communication every broker will behave as both the client and
                    the server towards other brokers. It is not uncommon for corporate CAs to have a signing profile for webservers and use this for Kafka as
                    well, which will only contain the <i>serverAuth</i> usage value and cause the SSL handshake to fail.
                </li>
                <li><b>Intermediate Certificates</b><br>
                    Corporate Root CAs are often kept offline for security reasons. To enable day-to-day usage, so called intermediate CAs are created, which
                    are then used to sign the final certificates. When importing a certificate into the keystore that was signed by an intermediate CA it is
                    necessarry to provide the entire chain of trust up to the root CA. This can be done by simply <i>cat</i>ing the certificate files into one
                    combined certificate file and then importing this with keytool.
                </li>
                <li><b>Failure to copy extension fields</b><br>
                    CA operators are often hesitant to copy and requested extension fields from CSRs and prefer to specify these themselves as this makes it
                    harder for a malicious party to obtain certificates with potentially misleading or fraudulent values.
                    It is adviseable to double check signed certificates, whether these contain all requested SAN fields to enable proper hostname verification.
                    The following command can be used to print certificate details to the console, which should be compared with what was originally requested:

            Kafka Brokers support listening for connections on multiple ports.
            We need to configure the following property in server.properties, which must have one or more comma-separated values:
            <pre>listeners</code></pre>

            If SSL is not enabled for inter-broker communication (see below for how to enable it), both PLAINTEXT and SSL ports will be necessary.
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">            listeners=PLAINTEXT://host.name:port,SSL://host.name:port</code></pre>

            Following SSL configs are needed on the broker side
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">            ssl.keystore.location=/var/private/ssl/server.keystore.jks
            ssl.keystore.password=test1234
            ssl.key.password=test1234
            ssl.truststore.location=/var/private/ssl/server.truststore.jks
            ssl.truststore.password=test1234</code></pre>

            Note: ssl.truststore.password is technically optional but highly recommended. If a password is not set access to the truststore is still available, but integrity checking is disabled.

            Optional settings that are worth considering:
            <ol>
                <li>ssl.client.auth=none ("required" => client authentication is required, "requested" => client authentication is requested and client without certs can still connect. The usage of "requested" is discouraged as it provides a false sense of security and misconfigured clients will still connect successfully.)</li>
                <li>ssl.cipher.suites (Optional). A cipher suite is a named combination of authentication, encryption, MAC and key exchange algorithm used to negotiate the security settings for a network connection using TLS or SSL network protocol. (Default is an empty list)</li>
                <li>ssl.enabled.protocols=TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1,TLSv1 (list out the SSL protocols that you are going to accept from clients. Do note that SSL is deprecated in favor of TLS and using SSL in production is not recommended)</li>
                <li>ssl.keystore.type=JKS</li>
                <li>ssl.truststore.type=JKS</li>
                <li>ssl.secure.random.implementation=SHA1PRNG</li>
            </ol>
            If you want to enable SSL for inter-broker communication, add the following to the server.properties file (it defaults to PLAINTEXT)
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">            security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL</code></pre>

            <p>
            Due to import regulations in some countries, the Oracle implementation limits the strength of cryptographic algorithms available by default. If stronger algorithms are needed (for example, AES with 256-bit keys), the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files</a> must be obtained and installed in the JDK/JRE. See the
            <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html">JCA Providers Documentation</a> for more information.
            </p>

            <p>
            The JRE/JDK will have a default pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) that is used for cryptography operations, so it is not required to configure the
            implementation used with the <code>ssl.secure.random.implementation</code>. However, there are performance issues with some implementations (notably, the
            default chosen on Linux systems, <code>NativePRNG</code>, utilizes a global lock). In cases where performance of SSL connections becomes an issue,
            consider explicitly setting the implementation to be used. The <code>SHA1PRNG</code> implementation is non-blocking, and has shown very good performance
            characteristics under heavy load (50 MB/sec of produced messages, plus replication traffic, per-broker).
            </p>

            Once you start the broker you should be able to see in the server.log
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">            with addresses: PLAINTEXT -> EndPoint(192.168.64.1,9092,PLAINTEXT),SSL -> EndPoint(192.168.64.1,9093,SSL)</code></pre>

            To check quickly if  the server keystore and truststore are setup properly you can run the following command
            <pre>openssl s_client -debug -connect localhost:9093 -tls1</code></pre> (Note: TLSv1 should be listed under ssl.enabled.protocols)<br>
            In the output of this command you should see server's certificate:
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">            -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
            {variable sized random bytes}
            -----END CERTIFICATE-----
            subject=/C=US/ST=CA/L=Santa Clara/O=org/OU=org/CN=Sriharsha Chintalapani
            issuer=/C=US/ST=CA/L=Santa Clara/O=org/OU=org/CN=kafka/emailAddress=test@test.com</code></pre>
            If the certificate does not show up or if there are any other error messages then your keystore is not setup properly.</li>

        <li><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_configclients" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_configclients">Configuring Kafka Clients</a></h4>
            SSL is supported only for the new Kafka Producer and Consumer, the older API is not supported. The configs for SSL will be the same for both producer and consumer.<br>
            If client authentication is not required in the broker, then the following is a minimal configuration example:
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">            security.protocol=SSL
            ssl.truststore.location=/var/private/ssl/client.truststore.jks
            ssl.truststore.password=test1234</code></pre>

            Note: ssl.truststore.password is technically optional but highly recommended. If a password is not set access to the truststore is still available, but integrity checking is disabled.

            If client authentication is required, then a keystore must be created like in step 1 and the following must also be configured:
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">            ssl.keystore.location=/var/private/ssl/client.keystore.jks
            ssl.keystore.password=test1234
            ssl.key.password=test1234</code></pre>

            Other configuration settings that may also be needed depending on our requirements and the broker configuration:
                <ol>
                    <li>ssl.provider (Optional). The name of the security provider used for SSL connections. Default value is the default security provider of the JVM.</li>
                    <li>ssl.cipher.suites (Optional). A cipher suite is a named combination of authentication, encryption, MAC and key exchange algorithm used to negotiate the security settings for a network connection using TLS or SSL network protocol.</li>
                    <li>ssl.enabled.protocols=TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1,TLSv1. It should list at least one of the protocols configured on the broker side</li>
                    <li>ssl.truststore.type=JKS</li>
                    <li>ssl.keystore.type=JKS</li>
                </ol>
    <br>
            Examples using console-producer and console-consumer:

    <p>Kafka uses the Java Authentication and Authorization Service
    (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jaas/JAASRefGuide.html">JAAS</a>)
    for SASL configuration.</p>

        <li><h5><a id="security_jaas_broker"
            href="#security_jaas_broker">JAAS configuration for Kafka brokers</a></h5>

            <p><tt>KafkaServer</tt> is the section name in the JAAS file used by each
            KafkaServer/Broker. This section provides SASL configuration options
            for the broker including any SASL client connections made by the broker
            for inter-broker communication. If multiple listeners are configured to use
            SASL, the section name may be prefixed with the listener name in lower-case
            followed by a period, e.g. <tt>sasl_ssl.KafkaServer</tt>.</p>

            <p><tt>Client</tt> section is used to authenticate a SASL connection with
            zookeeper. It also allows the brokers to set SASL ACL on zookeeper
            nodes which locks these nodes down so that only the brokers can
            modify it. It is necessary to have the same principal name across all
            brokers. If you want to use a section name other than Client, set the
            system property <tt>zookeeper.sasl.clientconfig</tt> to the appropriate
            name (<i>e.g.</i>, <tt>-Dzookeeper.sasl.clientconfig=ZkClient</tt>).</p>

            <p>ZooKeeper uses "zookeeper" as the service name by default. If you
            want to change this, set the system property
            <tt>zookeeper.sasl.client.username</tt> to the appropriate name
            (<i>e.g.</i>, <tt>-Dzookeeper.sasl.client.username=zk</tt>).</p>

            <p>Brokers may also configure JAAS using the broker configuration property <code>sasl.jaas.config</code>.
            The property name must be prefixed with the listener prefix including the SASL mechanism,
            i.e. <code>listener.name.{listenerName}.{saslMechanism}.sasl.jaas.config</code>. Only one
            login module may be specified in the config value. If multiple mechanisms are configured on a
            listener, configs must be provided for each mechanism using the listener and mechanism prefix.
            For example,
                    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">        listener.name.sasl_ssl.scram-sha-256.sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.scram.ScramLoginModule required \
            username="admin" \
            password="admin-secret";
        listener.name.sasl_ssl.plain.sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required \
            username="admin" \
            password="admin-secret" \
            user_admin="admin-secret" \
            user_alice="alice-secret";</code></pre>

            If JAAS configuration is defined at different levels, the order of precedence used is:
            <ul>
              <li>Broker configuration property <code>listener.name.{listenerName}.{saslMechanism}.sasl.jaas.config</code></li>
              <li><code>{listenerName}.KafkaServer</code> section of static JAAS configuration</code></li>
              <li><code>KafkaServer</code> section of static JAAS configuration</code></li>
            </ul>
            Note that ZooKeeper JAAS config may only be configured using static JAAS configuration.

            If your organization is already using a Kerberos server (for example, by using Active Directory), there is no need to install a new server just for Kafka. Otherwise you will need to install one, your Linux vendor likely has packages for Kerberos and a short guide on how to install and configure it (<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kerberos">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Managing_Smart_Cards/installing-kerberos.html">Redhat</a>).

            <li><b>Create Kerberos Principals</b><br>
            If you are using the organization's Kerberos or Active Directory server, ask your Kerberos administrator for a principal for each Kafka broker in your cluster and for every operating system user that will access Kafka with Kerberos authentication (via clients and tools).</br>
            If you have installed your own Kerberos, you will need to create these principals yourself using the following commands:
                <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">        sudo /usr/sbin/kadmin.local -q 'addprinc -randkey kafka/{hostname}@{REALM}'

            </li>
            <tt>KafkaServer</tt> section in the JAAS file tells the broker which principal to use and the location of the keytab where this principal is stored. It
            allows the broker to login using the keytab specified in this section. See <a href="#security_jaas_broker">notes</a> for more details on Zookeeper SASL configuration.
            <li>Pass the JAAS and optionally the krb5 file locations as JVM parameters to each Kafka broker (see <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jgss/tutorials/KerberosReq.html">here</a> for more details):

            To configure SASL authentication on the clients:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Clients (producers, consumers, connect workers, etc) will authenticate to the cluster with their
                    own principal (usually with the same name as the user running the client), so obtain or create
                    these principals as needed. Then configure the JAAS configuration property for each client.
                    Different clients within a JVM may run as different users by specifying different principals.
                    The property <code>sasl.jaas.config</code> in producer.properties or consumer.properties describes
                    how clients like producer and consumer can connect to the Kafka Broker. The following is an example
                    configuration for a client using a keytab (recommended for long-running processes):
                <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">    sasl.jaas.config=com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required \

        keyTab="/etc/security/keytabs/kafka_client.keytab" \
        principal="kafka-client-1@EXAMPLE.COM";</code></pre>

                   For command-line utilities like kafka-console-consumer or kafka-console-producer, kinit can be used
                   along with "useTicketCache=true" as in:

                   JAAS configuration for clients may alternatively be specified as a JVM parameter similar to brokers
                   as described <a href="#security_client_staticjaas">here</a>. Clients use the login section named
                   <tt>KafkaClient</tt>. This option allows only one user for all client connections from a JVM.</li>

        <p>SASL/PLAIN is a simple username/password authentication mechanism that is typically used with TLS for encryption to implement secure authentication.
        Kafka supports a default implementation for SASL/PLAIN which can be extended for production use as described <a href="#security_sasl_plain_production">here</a>.</p>
        The username is used as the authenticated <code>Principal</code> for configuration of ACLs etc.

                This configuration defines two users (<i>admin</i> and <i>alice</i>). The properties <tt>username</tt> and <tt>password</tt>
                in the <tt>KafkaServer</tt> section are used by the broker to initiate connections to other brokers. In this example,
                <i>admin</i> is the user for inter-broker communication. The set of properties <tt>user_<i>userName</i></tt> defines
                the passwords for all users that connect to the broker and the broker validates all client connections including

    <li><h4><a id="security_sasl_scram" href="#security_sasl_scram">Authentication using SASL/SCRAM</a></h4>
        <p>Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) is a family of SASL mechanisms that
        addresses the security concerns with traditional mechanisms that perform username/password authentication
        like PLAIN and DIGEST-MD5. The mechanism is defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802">RFC 5802</a>.
        Kafka supports <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7677">SCRAM-SHA-256</a> and SCRAM-SHA-512 which
        can be used with TLS to perform secure authentication. The username is used as the authenticated
        <code>Principal</code> for configuration of ACLs etc. The default SCRAM implementation in Kafka
        stores SCRAM credentials in Zookeeper and is suitable for use in Kafka installations where Zookeeper
        is on a private network. Refer to <a href="#security_sasl_scram_security">Security Considerations</a>
        for more details.</p>

        <p>The SCRAM implementation in Kafka uses Zookeeper as credential store. Credentials can be created in
        Zookeeper using <tt>kafka-configs.sh</tt>. For each SCRAM mechanism enabled, credentials must be created
        by adding a config with the mechanism name. Credentials for inter-broker communication must be created
        before Kafka brokers are started. Client credentials may be created and updated dynamically and updated
        credentials will be used to authenticate new connections.</p>
        <p>Create SCRAM credentials for user <i>alice</i> with password <i>alice-secret</i>:
        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">    > bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2182 --zk-tls-config-file zk_tls_config.properties --alter --add-config 'SCRAM-SHA-256=[iterations=8192,password=alice-secret],SCRAM-SHA-512=[password=alice-secret]' --entity-type users --entity-name alice</code></pre>
        <p>The default iteration count of 4096 is used if iterations are not specified. A random salt is created
        and the SCRAM identity consisting of salt, iterations, StoredKey and ServerKey are stored in Zookeeper.
        See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802">RFC 5802</a> for details on SCRAM identity and the individual fields.
        <p>The following examples also require a user <i>admin</i> for inter-broker communication which can be created using:
        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">    > bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2182 --zk-tls-config-file zk_tls_config.properties --alter --add-config 'SCRAM-SHA-256=[password=admin-secret],SCRAM-SHA-512=[password=admin-secret]' --entity-type users --entity-name admin</code></pre>

    <li><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_delegation_token" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_delegation_token">Authentication using Delegation Tokens</a></h4>
        <p>Delegation token based authentication is a lightweight authentication mechanism to complement existing SASL/SSL
            methods. Delegation tokens are shared secrets between kafka brokers and clients. Delegation tokens will help processing
            frameworks to distribute the workload to available workers in a secure environment without the added cost of distributing
            Kerberos TGT/keytabs or keystores when 2-way SSL is used. See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-48+Delegation+token+support+for+Kafka">KIP-48</a>
            for more details.</p>

        <p>Typical steps for delegation token usage are:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>User authenticates with the Kafka cluster via SASL or SSL, and obtains a delegation token. This can be done
            using Admin APIs or using <tt>kafka-delegation-tokens.sh</tt> script.</li>
        <li>User securely passes the delegation token to Kafka clients for authenticating with the Kafka cluster.</li>
        <li>Token owner/renewer can renew/expire the delegation tokens.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
        <li><h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_token_management" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_token_management">Token Management</a></h5>
        <p> A secret is used to generate and verify delegation tokens. This is supplied using config
            option <tt>delegation.token.secret.key</tt>. The same secret key must be configured across all the brokers.
            If the secret is not set or set to empty string, brokers will disable the delegation token authentication.</p>

        <p>In the current implementation, token details are stored in Zookeeper and is suitable for use in Kafka installations where
            Zookeeper is on a private network. Also currently, this secret is stored as plain text in the server.properties
            config file. We intend to make these configurable in a future Kafka release.</p>

        <p>A token has a current life, and a maximum renewable life. By default, tokens must be renewed once every 24 hours
            for up to 7 days. These can be configured using <tt>delegation.token.expiry.time.ms</tt>
            and <tt>delegation.token.max.lifetime.ms</tt> config options.</p>

        <p>Tokens can also be cancelled explicitly.  If a token is not renewed by the token’s expiration time or if token
            is beyond the max life time, it will be deleted from all broker caches as well as from zookeeper.</p>
        </li>

        <li><h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_sasl_create_tokens" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_sasl_create_tokens">Creating Delegation Tokens</a></h5>
        <p>Tokens can be created by using Admin APIs or using <tt>kafka-delegation-tokens.sh</tt> script.
            Delegation token requests (create/renew/expire/describe) should be issued only on SASL or SSL authenticated channels.
            Tokens can not be requests if the initial authentication is done through delegation token.
            <tt>kafka-delegation-tokens.sh</tt> script examples are given below.</p>
        <p>Create a delegation token:
        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">    > bin/kafka-delegation-tokens.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create   --max-life-time-period -1 --command-config client.properties --renewer-principal User:user1</code></pre>
        <p>Renew a delegation token:
        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">    > bin/kafka-delegation-tokens.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --renew    --renew-time-period -1 --command-config client.properties --hmac ABCDEFGHIJK</code></pre>
        <p>Expire a delegation token:
        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">    > bin/kafka-delegation-tokens.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --expire   --expiry-time-period -1   --command-config client.properties  --hmac ABCDEFGHIJK</code></pre>
        <p>Existing tokens can be described using the --describe option:
        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">    > bin/kafka-delegation-tokens.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --command-config client.properties  --owner-principal User:user1</code></pre>

        <li><h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_token_authentication" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_token_authentication">Token Authentication</a></h5>
            <p>Delegation token authentication piggybacks on the current SASL/SCRAM authentication mechanism. We must enable
                SASL/SCRAM mechanism on Kafka cluster as described in <a href="#security_sasl_scram">here</a>.</p>

             <p>Configuring Kafka Clients:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Configure the JAAS configuration property for each client in producer.properties or consumer.properties.
                The login module describes how the clients like producer and consumer can connect to the Kafka Broker.
                The following is an example configuration for a client for the token authentication:
                <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">   sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.scram.ScramLoginModule required \
        username="tokenID123" \
        password="lAYYSFmLs4bTjf+lTZ1LCHR/ZZFNA==" \
        tokenauth="true";</code></pre>

                <p>The options <tt>username</tt> and <tt>password</tt> are used by clients to configure the token id and
                    token HMAC. And the option <tt>tokenauth</tt> is used to indicate the server about token authentication.
                    In this example, clients connect to the broker using token id: <i>tokenID123</i>. Different clients within a
                    JVM may connect using different tokens by specifying different token details in <code>sasl.jaas.config</code>.</p>

                <p>JAAS configuration for clients may alternatively be specified as a JVM parameter similar to brokers
                as described <a href="#security_client_staticjaas">here</a>. Clients use the login section named
                <tt>KafkaClient</tt>. This option allows only one user for all client connections from a JVM.</p></li>

    <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_authz" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_authz">7.4 Authorization and ACLs</a></h3>
    Kafka ships with a pluggable Authorizer and an out-of-box authorizer implementation that uses zookeeper to store all the acls. The Authorizer is configured by setting <tt>authorizer.class.name</tt> in server.properties. To enable the out of the box implementation use:
    <pre>authorizer.class.name=kafka.security.authorizer.AclAuthorizer</code></pre>
    Kafka acls are defined in the general format of "Principal P is [Allowed/Denied] Operation O From Host H on any Resource R matching ResourcePattern RP". You can read more about the acl structure in <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-11+-+Authorization+Interface">KIP-11</a> and resource patterns in <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-290%3A+Support+for+Prefixed+ACLs">KIP-290</a>. In order to add, remove or list acls you can use the Kafka authorizer CLI. By default, if no ResourcePatterns match a specific Resource R, then R has no associated acls, and therefore no one other than super users is allowed to access R. If you want to change that behavior, you can include the following in server.properties.
    <pre>allow.everyone.if.no.acl.found=true</code></pre>
    One can also add super users in server.properties like the following (note that the delimiter is semicolon since SSL user names may contain comma). Default PrincipalType string "User" is case sensitive.
    <pre>super.users=User:Bob;User:Alice</code></pre>

    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_authz_ssl" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_authz_ssl">Customizing SSL User Name</a></h5>

    By default, the SSL user name will be of the form "CN=writeuser,OU=Unknown,O=Unknown,L=Unknown,ST=Unknown,C=Unknown". One can change that by setting <code>ssl.principal.mapping.rules</code> to a customized rule in server.properties.
    This config allows a list of rules for mapping X.500 distinguished name to short name. The rules are evaluated in order and the first rule that matches a distinguished name is used to map it to a short name. Any later rules in the list are ignored.

    <br>The format of <code>ssl.principal.mapping.rules</code> is a list where each rule starts with "RULE:" and contains an expression as the following formats. Default rule will return
    string representation of the X.500 certificate distinguished name. If the distinguished name matches the pattern, then the replacement command will be run over the name.
    This also supports lowercase/uppercase options, to force the translated result to be all lower/uppercase case. This is done by adding a "/L" or "/U' to the end of the rule.

    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">        RULE:pattern/replacement/
        RULE:pattern/replacement/[LU]</code></pre>

    Example <code>ssl.principal.mapping.rules</code> values are:
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">        RULE:^CN=(.*?),OU=ServiceUsers.*$/$1/,
        RULE:^CN=(.*?),OU=(.*?),O=(.*?),L=(.*?),ST=(.*?),C=(.*?)$/$1@$2/L,
        RULE:^.*[Cc][Nn]=([a-zA-Z0-9.]*).*$/$1/L,
        DEFAULT</code></pre>

    Above rules translate distinguished name "CN=serviceuser,OU=ServiceUsers,O=Unknown,L=Unknown,ST=Unknown,C=Unknown" to "serviceuser"
    and "CN=adminUser,OU=Admin,O=Unknown,L=Unknown,ST=Unknown,C=Unknown" to "adminuser@admin".

    <br>For advanced use cases, one can customize the name by setting a customized PrincipalBuilder in server.properties like the following.
    <pre>principal.builder.class=CustomizedPrincipalBuilderClass</code></pre>

    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_authz_sasl" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_authz_sasl">Customizing SASL User Name</a></h5>

    By default, the SASL user name will be the primary part of the Kerberos principal. One can change that by setting <code>sasl.kerberos.principal.to.local.rules</code> to a customized rule in server.properties.
    The format of <code>sasl.kerberos.principal.to.local.rules</code> is a list where each rule works in the same way as the auth_to_local in <a href="http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html">Kerberos configuration file (krb5.conf)</a>. This also support additional lowercase/uppercase rule, to force the translated result to be all lowercase/uppercase. This is done by adding a "/L" or "/U" to the end of the rule. check below formats for syntax.
    Each rules starts with RULE: and contains an expression as the following formats. See the kerberos documentation for more details.
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">        RULE:[n:string](regexp)s/pattern/replacement/
        RULE:[n:string](regexp)s/pattern/replacement/g
        RULE:[n:string](regexp)s/pattern/replacement//L
        RULE:[n:string](regexp)s/pattern/replacement/g/L
        RULE:[n:string](regexp)s/pattern/replacement//U
        RULE:[n:string](regexp)s/pattern/replacement/g/U</code></pre>

    An example of adding a rule to properly translate user@MYDOMAIN.COM to user while also keeping the default rule in place is:
    <pre>sasl.kerberos.principal.to.local.rules=RULE:[1:$1@$0](.*@MYDOMAIN.COM)s/@.*//,DEFAULT</code></pre>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Adding Acls</b><br>
    Suppose you want to add an acl "Principals User:Bob and User:Alice are allowed to perform Operation Read and Write on Topic Test-Topic from IP 198.51.100.0 and IP 198.51.100.1". You can do that by executing the CLI with following options:
            <pre class="language-bash">bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --add --allow-principal User:Bob --allow-principal User:Alice --allow-host 198.51.100.0 --allow-host 198.51.100.1 --operation Read --operation Write --topic Test-topic</code></pre>
            By default, all principals that don't have an explicit acl that allows access for an operation to a resource are denied. In rare cases where an allow acl is defined that allows access to all but some principal we will have to use the --deny-principal and --deny-host option. For example, if we want to allow all users to Read from Test-topic but only deny User:BadBob from IP 198.51.100.3 we can do so using following commands:
            <pre class="language-bash">bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --add --allow-principal User:* --allow-host * --deny-principal User:BadBob --deny-host 198.51.100.3 --operation Read --topic Test-topic</code></pre>
            Note that <code>--allow-host</code> and <code>--deny-host</code> only support IP addresses (hostnames are not supported).
            Above examples add acls to a topic by specifying --topic [topic-name] as the resource pattern option. Similarly user can add acls to cluster by specifying --cluster and to a consumer group by specifying --group [group-name].
            You can add acls on any resource of a certain type, e.g. suppose you wanted to add an acl "Principal User:Peter is allowed to produce to any Topic from IP 198.51.200.0"
            You can do that by using the wildcard resource '*', e.g. by executing the CLI with following options:
            <pre class="language-bash">bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --add --allow-principal User:Peter --allow-host 198.51.200.1 --producer --topic *</code></pre>
            You can add acls on prefixed resource patterns, e.g. suppose you want to add an acl "Principal User:Jane is allowed to produce to any Topic whose name starts with 'Test-' from any host".
            You can do that by executing the CLI with following options:
            <pre class="language-bash">bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --add --allow-principal User:Jane --producer --topic Test- --resource-pattern-type prefixed</code></pre>
            Note, --resource-pattern-type defaults to 'literal', which only affects resources with the exact same name or, in the case of the wildcard resource name '*', a resource with any name.</li>

        <li><b>Removing Acls</b><br>
                Removing acls is pretty much the same. The only difference is instead of --add option users will have to specify --remove option. To remove the acls added by the first example above we can execute the CLI with following options:
            <pre class="language-bash"> bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --remove --allow-principal User:Bob --allow-principal User:Alice --allow-host 198.51.100.0 --allow-host 198.51.100.1 --operation Read --operation Write --topic Test-topic </code></pre>
            If you want to remove the acl added to the prefixed resource pattern above we can execute the CLI with following options:
            <pre class="language-bash"> bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --remove --allow-principal User:Jane --producer --topic Test- --resource-pattern-type Prefixed</code></pre></li>

        <li><b>List Acls</b><br>
                We can list acls for any resource by specifying the --list option with the resource. To list all acls on the literal resource pattern Test-topic, we can execute the CLI with following options:
                <pre class="language-bash">bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --list --topic Test-topic</code></pre>
                However, this will only return the acls that have been added to this exact resource pattern. Other acls can exist that affect access to the topic,
                e.g. any acls on the topic wildcard '*', or any acls on prefixed resource patterns. Acls on the wildcard resource pattern can be queried explicitly:
                <pre class="language-bash">bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --list --topic *</code></pre>
                However, it is not necessarily possible to explicitly query for acls on prefixed resource patterns that match Test-topic as the name of such patterns may not be known.
                We can list <i>all</i> acls affecting Test-topic by using '--resource-pattern-type match', e.g.
                <pre class="language-bash">bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --list --topic Test-topic --resource-pattern-type match</code></pre>
                This will list acls on all matching literal, wildcard and prefixed resource patterns.</li>

        <li><b>Adding or removing a principal as producer or consumer</b><br>
                The most common use case for acl management are adding/removing a principal as producer or consumer so we added convenience options to handle these cases. In order to add User:Bob as a producer of  Test-topic we can execute the following command:
            <pre class="language-bash"> bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --add --allow-principal User:Bob --producer --topic Test-topic</code></pre>
                Similarly to add Alice as a consumer of Test-topic with consumer group Group-1 we just have to pass --consumer option:
            <pre class="language-bash"> bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --add --allow-principal User:Bob --consumer --topic Test-topic --group Group-1 </code></pre>
                Note that for consumer option we must also specify the consumer group.
                In order to remove a principal from producer or consumer role we just need to pass --remove option. </li>

        <li><b>Admin API based acl management</b><br>
            Users having Alter permission on ClusterResource can use Admin API for ACL management. kafka-acls.sh script supports AdminClient API to manage ACLs without interacting with zookeeper/authorizer directly.
            All the above examples can be executed by using <b>--bootstrap-server</b> option. For example:

            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">            bin/kafka-acls.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --command-config /tmp/adminclient-configs.conf --add --allow-principal User:Bob --producer --topic Test-topic
            bin/kafka-acls.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --command-config /tmp/adminclient-configs.conf --add --allow-principal User:Bob --consumer --topic Test-topic --group Group-1
            bin/kafka-acls.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --command-config /tmp/adminclient-configs.conf --list --topic Test-topic</code></pre></li>

    </ul>

    <p>Protocol calls are usually performing some operations on certain resources in Kafka. It is required to know the
        operations and resources to set up effective protection. In this section we'll list these operations and
        resources, then list the combination of these with the protocols to see the valid scenarios.</p>
    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="operations_in_kafka" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#operations_in_kafka">Operations in Kafka</a></h5>
    <p>There are a few operation primitives that can be used to build up privileges. These can be matched up with
        certain resources to allow specific protocol calls for a given user. These are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Read</li>
        <li>Write</li>
        <li>Create</li>
        <li>Delete</li>
        <li>Alter</li>
        <li>Describe</li>
        <li>ClusterAction</li>
        <li>DescribeConfigs</li>
        <li>AlterConfigs</li>
        <li>IdempotentWrite</li>
        <li>All</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="resources_in_kafka" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#resources_in_kafka">Resources in Kafka</a></h5>
    <p>The operations above can be applied on certain resources which are described below.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Topic:</b> this simply represents a Topic. All protocol calls that are acting on topics (such as reading,
            writing them) require the corresponding privilege to be added. If there is an authorization error with a
            topic resource, then a TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (error code: 29) will be returned.</li>
        <li><b>Group:</b> this represents the consumer groups in the brokers. All protocol calls that are working with
            consumer groups, like joining a group must have privileges with the group in subject. If the privilege is not
            given then a GROUP_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (error code: 30) will be returned in the protocol response.</li>
        <li><b>Cluster:</b> this resource represents the cluster. Operations that are affecting the whole cluster, like
            controlled shutdown are protected by privileges on the Cluster resource. If there is an authorization problem
            on a cluster resource, then a CLUSTER_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (error code: 31) will be returned.</li>
        <li><b>TransactionalId:</b> this resource represents actions related to transactions, such as committing.
            If any error occurs, then a TRANSACTIONAL_ID_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (error code: 53) will be returned by brokers.</li>
        <li><b>DelegationToken:</b> this represents the delegation tokens in the cluster. Actions, such as describing
            delegation tokens could be protected by a privilege on the DelegationToken resource. Since these objects have
            a little special behavior in Kafka it is recommended to read
            <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-48+Delegation+token+support+for+Kafka#KIP-48DelegationtokensupportforKafka-DescribeDelegationTokenRequest">KIP-48</a>
            and the related upstream documentation at <a href="#security_delegation_token">Authentication using Delegation Tokens</a>.</li>

    <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_rolling_upgrade" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_rolling_upgrade">7.5 Incorporating Security Features in a Running Cluster</a></h3>
        You can secure a running cluster via one or more of the supported protocols discussed previously. This is done in phases:
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Incrementally bounce the cluster nodes to open additional secured port(s).</li>
            <li>Restart clients using the secured rather than PLAINTEXT port (assuming you are securing the client-broker connection).</li>
            <li>Incrementally bounce the cluster again to enable broker-to-broker security (if this is required)</li>
            <li>A final incremental bounce to close the PLAINTEXT port.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        The specific steps for configuring SSL and SASL are described in sections <a href="#security_ssl">7.2</a> and <a href="#security_sasl">7.3</a>.
        Follow these steps to enable security for your desired protocol(s).
        <p></p>
        The security implementation lets you configure different protocols for both broker-client and broker-broker communication.
        These must be enabled in separate bounces. A PLAINTEXT port must be left open throughout so brokers and/or clients can continue to communicate.
        <p></p>

        When performing an incremental bounce stop the brokers cleanly via a SIGTERM. It's also good practice to wait for restarted replicas to return to the ISR list before moving onto the next node.
        <p></p>
        As an example, say we wish to encrypt both broker-client and broker-broker communication with SSL. In the first incremental bounce, an SSL port is opened on each node:
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">            listeners=PLAINTEXT://broker1:9091,SSL://broker1:9092</code></pre>

        We then restart the clients, changing their config to point at the newly opened, secured port:

            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">            bootstrap.servers = [broker1:9092,...]
            security.protocol = SSL
            ...etc</code></pre>

        In the second incremental server bounce we instruct Kafka to use SSL as the broker-broker protocol (which will use the same SSL port):

            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">            listeners=PLAINTEXT://broker1:9091,SSL://broker1:9092
            security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL</code></pre>

        In the final bounce we secure the cluster by closing the PLAINTEXT port:

            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">            listeners=SSL://broker1:9092
            security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL</code></pre>

        Alternatively we might choose to open multiple ports so that different protocols can be used for broker-broker and broker-client communication. Say we wished to use SSL encryption throughout (i.e. for broker-broker and broker-client communication) but we'd like to add SASL authentication to the broker-client connection also. We would achieve this by opening two additional ports during the first bounce:

            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">            listeners=PLAINTEXT://broker1:9091,SSL://broker1:9092,SASL_SSL://broker1:9093</code></pre>

        We would then restart the clients, changing their config to point at the newly opened, SASL & SSL secured port:

            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">            bootstrap.servers = [broker1:9093,...]
            security.protocol = SASL_SSL
            ...etc</code></pre>

        The second server bounce would switch the cluster to use encrypted broker-broker communication via the SSL port we previously opened on port 9092:

            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">            listeners=PLAINTEXT://broker1:9091,SSL://broker1:9092,SASL_SSL://broker1:9093
            security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL</code></pre>

        The final bounce secures the cluster by closing the PLAINTEXT port.

            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">        listeners=SSL://broker1:9092,SASL_SSL://broker1:9093
        security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL</code></pre>

        ZooKeeper can be secured independently of the Kafka cluster. The steps for doing this are covered in section <a href="#zk_authz_migration">7.6.2</a>.


    <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="zk_authz" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#zk_authz">7.6 ZooKeeper Authentication</a></h3>
    ZooKeeper supports mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication beginning with the 3.5.x versions.
    Kafka supports authenticating to ZooKeeper with SASL and mTLS -- either individually or both together --
    beginning with version 2.5. See
    <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-515%3A+Enable+ZK+client+to+use+the+new+TLS+supported+authentication">KIP-515: Enable ZK client to use the new TLS supported authentication</a>
    for more details.
    <p>When using mTLS alone, every broker and any CLI tools (such as the <a href="#zk_authz_migration">ZooKeeper Security Migration Tool</a>)
        should identify itself with the same Distinguished Name (DN) because it is the DN that is ACL'ed.
        This can be changed as described below, but it involves writing and deploying a custom ZooKeeper authentication provider.
        Generally each certificate should have the same DN but a different Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
        so that hostname verification of the brokers and any CLI tools by ZooKeeper will succeed.
        <p>
        When using SASL authentication to ZooKeeper together with mTLS, both the SASL identity and
        either the DN that created the znode (i.e. the creating broker's certificate)
        or the DN of the Security Migration Tool (if migration was performed after the znode was created)
        will be ACL'ed, and all brokers and CLI tools will be authorized even if they all use different DNs
        because they will all use the same ACL'ed SASL identity.
        It is only when  using mTLS authentication alone that all the DNs must match (and SANs become critical --
        again, in the absence of writing and deploying a custom ZooKeeper authentication provider as described below).
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Use the broker properties file to set TLS configs for brokers as described below.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use the <tt>--zk-tls-config-file &lt;file&gt;</tt> option to set TLS configs in the Zookeeper Security Migration Tool.
        The <tt>kafka-acls.sh</tt> and <tt>kafka-configs.sh</tt> CLI tools also support the <tt>--zk-tls-config-file &lt;file&gt;</tt> option.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use the <tt>-zk-tls-config-file &lt;file&gt;</tt> option (note the single-dash rather than double-dash)
        to set TLS configs for the <tt>zookeeper-shell.sh</tt> CLI tool.
    </p>
    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="zk_authz_new" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#zk_authz_new">7.6.1 New clusters</a></h4>
    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="zk_authz_new_sasl" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#zk_authz_new_sasl">7.6.1.1 ZooKeeper SASL Authentication</a></h5>
    To enable ZooKeeper SASL authentication on brokers, there are two necessary steps:
    <ol>
        <li> Create a JAAS login file and set the appropriate system property to point to it as described above</li>
        <li> Set the configuration property <tt>zookeeper.set.acl</tt> in each broker to true</li>
    </ol>

    The metadata stored in ZooKeeper for the Kafka cluster is world-readable, but can only be modified by the brokers. The rationale behind this decision is that the data stored in ZooKeeper is not sensitive, but inappropriate manipulation of that data can cause cluster disruption. We also recommend limiting the access to ZooKeeper via network segmentation (only brokers and some admin tools need access to ZooKeeper).

    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="zk_authz_new_mtls" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#zk_authz_new_mtls">7.6.1.2 ZooKeeper Mutual TLS Authentication</a></h5>
    ZooKeeper mTLS authentication can be enabled with or without SASL authentication.  As mentioned above,
    when using mTLS alone, every broker and any CLI tools (such as the <a href="#zk_authz_migration">ZooKeeper Security Migration Tool</a>)
    must generally identify itself with the same Distinguished Name (DN) because it is the DN that is ACL'ed, which means
    each certificate should have an appropriate Subject Alternative Name (SAN) so that
    hostname verification of the brokers and any CLI tool by ZooKeeper will succeed.
    <p>
        It is possible to use something other than the DN for the identity of mTLS clients by writing a class that
        extends <tt>org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.X509AuthenticationProvider</tt> and overrides the method
        <tt>protected String getClientId(X509Certificate clientCert)</tt>.
        Choose a scheme name and set <tt>authProvider.[scheme]</tt> in ZooKeeper to be the fully-qualified class name
        of the custom implementation; then set <tt>ssl.authProvider=[scheme]</tt> to use it.
    </p>
    Here is a sample (partial) ZooKeeper configuration for enabling TLS authentication.
    These configurations are described in the
    <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.5.7/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_authOptions">ZooKeeper Admin Guide</a>.
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">        secureClientPort=2182

    <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: ZooKeeper does not support setting the key password in the ZooKeeper server keystore
    to a value different from the keystore password itself.
    Be sure to set the key password to be the same as the keystore password.

    If you are running a version of Kafka that does not support security or simply with security disabled, and you want to make the cluster secure, then you need to execute the following steps to enable ZooKeeper authentication with minimal disruption to your operations:
    <ol>
        <li>Enable SASL and/or mTLS authentication on ZooKeeper.  If enabling mTLS, you would now have both a non-TLS port and a TLS port, like this:
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">    clientPort=2181
    secureClientPort=2182
    serverCnxnFactory=org.apache.zookeeper.server.NettyServerCnxnFactory
    authProvider.x509=org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.X509AuthenticationProvider
    ssl.keyStore.location=/path/to/zk/keystore.jks
    ssl.keyStore.password=zk-ks-passwd
    ssl.trustStore.location=/path/to/zk/truststore.jks
    ssl.trustStore.password=zk-ts-passwd</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Perform a rolling restart of brokers setting the JAAS login file and/or defining ZooKeeper mutual TLS configurations (including connecting to the TLS-enabled ZooKeeper port) as required, which enables brokers to authenticate to ZooKeeper. At the end of the rolling restart, brokers are able to manipulate znodes with strict ACLs, but they will not create znodes with those ACLs</li>
        <li>If you enabled mTLS, disable the non-TLS port in ZooKeeper</li>
        <li>Perform a second rolling restart of brokers, this time setting the configuration parameter <tt>zookeeper.set.acl</tt> to true, which enables the use of secure ACLs when creating znodes</li>
        <li>Execute the ZkSecurityMigrator tool. To execute the tool, there is this script: <tt>bin/zookeeper-security-migration.sh</tt> with <tt>zookeeper.acl</tt> set to secure. This tool traverses the corresponding sub-trees changing the ACLs of the znodes. Use the <code>--zk-tls-config-file &lt;file&gt;</code> option if you enable mTLS.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is also possible to turn off authentication in a secure cluster. To do it, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Perform a rolling restart of brokers setting the JAAS login file and/or defining ZooKeeper mutual TLS configurations, which enables brokers to authenticate, but setting <tt>zookeeper.set.acl</tt> to false. At the end of the rolling restart, brokers stop creating znodes with secure ACLs, but are still able to authenticate and manipulate all znodes</li>
        <li>Execute the ZkSecurityMigrator tool. To execute the tool, run this script <tt>bin/zookeeper-security-migration.sh</tt> with <tt>zookeeper.acl</tt> set to unsecure. This tool traverses the corresponding sub-trees changing the ACLs of the znodes. Use the <code>--zk-tls-config-file &lt;file&gt;</code> option if you need to set TLS configuration.</li></li>
        <li>If you are disabling mTLS, enable the non-TLS port in ZooKeeper</li>
        <li>Perform a second rolling restart of brokers, this time omitting the system property that sets the JAAS login file and/or removing ZooKeeper mutual TLS configuration (including connecting to the non-TLS-enabled ZooKeeper port) as required</li>
        <li>If you are disabling mTLS, disable the TLS port in ZooKeeper</li>
    </ol>
    Here is an example of how to run the migration tool:
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">    bin/zookeeper-security-migration.sh --zookeeper.acl=secure --zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181</code></pre>
    <p>Run this to see the full list of parameters:</p>

    It is also necessary to enable SASL and/or mTLS authentication on the ZooKeeper ensemble. To do it, we need to perform a rolling restart of the server and set a few properties. See above for mTLS information.  Please refer to the ZooKeeper documentation for more detail:

    It is possible to enable mTLS authentication between the ZooKeeper servers themselves.

    <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="zk_encryption" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#zk_encryption">7.7 ZooKeeper Encryption</a></h3>
    ZooKeeper connections that use mutual TLS are encrypted.
    Beginning with ZooKeeper version 3.5.7 (the version shipped with Kafka version 2.5) ZooKeeper supports a sever-side config
    <tt>ssl.clientAuth</tt> (case-insensitively: <tt>want</tt>/<tt>need</tt>/<tt>none</tt> are the valid options, the default is <tt>need</tt>),
    and setting this value to <tt>none</tt> in ZooKeeper allows clients to connect via a TLS-encrypted connection
    without presenting their own certificate.  Here is a sample (partial) Kafka Broker configuration for connecting to ZooKeeper with just TLS encryption.
    These configurations are described above in <a href="#brokerconfigs">Broker Configs</a>.
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-text">        # connect to the ZooKeeper port configured for TLS
        zookeeper.connect=zk1:2182,zk2:2182,zk3:2182

        # define trust stores to use TLS to ZooKeeper; ignored unless zookeeper.ssl.client.enable=true
        # no need to set keystore information assuming ssl.clientAuth=none on ZooKeeper
        zookeeper.ssl.truststore.location=/path/to/kafka/truststore.jks
        zookeeper.ssl.truststore.password=kafka-ts-passwd
        # tell broker to create ACLs on znodes (if using SASL authentication, otherwise do not set this)
