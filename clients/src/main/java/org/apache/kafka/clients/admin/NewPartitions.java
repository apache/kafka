     * {@code NewPartition} constructed like this:</p>
     *
     * <pre><code>
     * NewPartitions.increaseTo(6, asList(asList(1, 2),
     *                                    asList(2, 3),
     *                                    asList(3, 1)))
     * </code></pre>
     * <p>In this example partition 3's preferred leader will be broker 1, partition 4's preferred leader will be
     * broker 2 and partition 5's preferred leader will be broker 3.</p>
