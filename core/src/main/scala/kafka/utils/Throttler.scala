 * A class to measure and throttle the rate of some process. The throttler takes a desired rate-per-second
 * (the units of the process don't matter, it could be bytes or a count of some other thing), and will sleep for 
 * an appropriate amount of time when maybeThrottle() is called to attain the desired rate.
 * 
 * @param desiredRatePerSec: The rate we want to hit in units/sec
 * @param checkIntervalMs: The interval at which to check our rate
 * @param throttleDown: Does throttling increase or decrease our rate?
