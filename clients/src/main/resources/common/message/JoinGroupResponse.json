  // Version 1 is the same as version 0.
  //
  // Version 2 adds throttle time.
  //
  // Starting in version 3, on quota violation, brokers send out responses before throttling.
  //
  // Starting in version 4, the client needs to issue a second request to join group
  // with assigned id.
  //
  // Version 5 is bumped to apply group.instance.id to identify member across restarts.
  //
  // Version 6 is the first flexible version.
  //
  // Starting from version 7, the broker sends back the Protocol Type to the client (KIP-559).
  //
  // Version 8 is the same as version 7.
  //
  // Version 9 adds the SkipAssignment field.
