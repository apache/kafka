  // Version 1 removes MaxNumOffsets.  From this version forward, only a single
  // offset can be returned.
  //
  // Version 2 adds the isolation level, which is used for transactional reads.
  //
  // Version 3 is the same as version 2.
  //
  // Version 4 adds the current leader epoch, which is used for fencing.
  //
  // Version 5 is the same as version 5.
  //
  // Version 6 is the same as version 5, but supports listing "next local offset"
  // (Timestamp = -3) for tiered storage.

With READ_COMMITTED (isolation_level = 1), non-transactional and COMMITTED transactional records are visible. To be more concrete, READ_COMMITTED returns all data from offsets smaller than the current LSO (last stable offset), and enables the inclusion of the list of aborted transactions in the result, which allows consumers to discard ABORTED transactional records" },
