/**
 * {@code KTable} is an abstraction of a <i>changelog stream</i> from a primary-keyed table.
 * Each record in this changelog stream is an update on the primary-keyed table with the record key as the primary key.
 * <p>
 * A {@code KTable} is either {@link StreamsBuilder#table(String) defined from a single Kafka topic} that is
 * consumed message by message or the result of a {@code KTable} transformation.
 * An aggregation of a {@link KStream} also yields a {@code KTable}.
 * <p>
 * A {@code KTable} can be transformed record by record, joined with another {@code KTable} or {@link KStream}, or
 * can be re-partitioned and aggregated into a new {@code KTable}.
 * <p>
 * Some {@code KTable}s have an internal state (a {@link ReadOnlyKeyValueStore}) and are therefore queryable via the
 * interactive queries API.
 * For example:
 * <pre>{@code
 *     final KTable table = ...
 *     ...
 *     final KafkaStreams streams = ...;
 *     streams.start()
 *     ...
 *     final String queryableStoreName = table.queryableStoreName(); // returns null if KTable is not queryable
 *     ReadOnlyKeyValueStore view = streams.store(queryableStoreName, QueryableStoreTypes.timestampedKeyValueStore());
 *     view.get(key);
 *}</pre>
 *<p>
 * Records from the source topic that have null keys are dropped.
 *
 * @param <K> Type of primary keys
 * @param <V> Type of value changes
 * @see KStream
 * @see KGroupedTable
 * @see GlobalKTable
 * @see StreamsBuilder#table(String)

     * Create a new {@code KTable} by transforming the value of each record in this {@code KTable} into a new value
     * (with possibly a new type), with default serializers, deserializers, and state store.
     * A {@link ValueTransformerWithKey} (provided by the given {@link ValueTransformerWithKeySupplier}) is applied to each input
     * record value and computes a new value for it.
     * Thus, an input record {@code <K,V>} can be transformed into an output record {@code <K:V'>}.
     * This is similar to {@link #mapValues(ValueMapperWithKey)}, but more flexible, allowing access to additional state-stores,
     * and access to the {@link ProcessorContext}.
     * Furthermore, via {@link org.apache.kafka.streams.processor.Punctuator#punctuate(long)} the processing progress can be observed and additional
     * periodic actions can be performed.
     * <p>
     * If the downstream topology uses aggregation functions, (e.g. {@link KGroupedTable#reduce}, {@link KGroupedTable#aggregate}, etc),
     * care must be taken when dealing with state, (either held in state-stores or transformer instances), to ensure correct aggregate results.
     * In contrast, if the resulting KTable is materialized, (cf. {@link #transformValues(ValueTransformerWithKeySupplier, Materialized, String...)}),
     * such concerns are handled for you.
     * <p>
     * In order to assign a state, the state must be created and registered beforehand:

     * The result is an ever updating {@code KTable} that represents the <em>current</em> (i.e., processing time) result
     * of the join.
     * <p>
     * The join is computed by (1) updating the internal state of one {@code KTable} and (2) performing a lookup for a
     * matching record in the <em>current</em> (i.e., processing time) internal state of the other {@code KTable}.
     * This happens in a symmetric way, i.e., for each update of either {@code this} or the {@code other} input
     * {@code KTable} the result gets updated.
     * <p>
     * For each {@code KTable} record that finds a corresponding record in the other {@code KTable}'s state the
     * provided {@link ValueJoiner} will be called to compute a value (with arbitrary type) for the result record.
     * Additionally, for each record that does not find a corresponding record in the corresponding other
     * {@code KTable}'s state the provided {@link ValueJoiner} will be called with {@code null} value for the
     * corresponding other value to compute a value (with arbitrary type) for the result record.
     * The key of the result record is the same as for both joining input records.
     * <p>
     * Note that {@link KeyValue records} with {@code null} values (so-called tombstone records) have delete semantics.
     * Thus, for input tombstones the provided value-joiner is not called but a tombstone record is forwarded directly
     * to delete a record in the result {@code KTable} if required (i.e., if there is anything to be deleted).
     * <p>
