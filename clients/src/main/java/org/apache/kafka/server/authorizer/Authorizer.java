/**
 *
 * Pluggable authorizer interface for Kafka brokers.
 *
 * Startup sequence in brokers:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Broker creates authorizer instance if configured in `authorizer.class.name`.</li>
 *   <li>Broker configures and starts authorizer instance. Authorizer implementation starts loading its metadata.</li>
 *   <li>Broker starts SocketServer to accept connections and process requests.</li>
 *   <li>For each listener, SocketServer waits for authorization metadata to be available in the
 *       authorizer before accepting connections. The future returned by {@link #start(AuthorizerServerInfo)}
 *       for each listener must return only when authorizer is ready to authorize requests on the listener.</li>
 *   <li>Broker accepts connections. For each connection, broker performs authentication and then accepts Kafka requests.
 *       For each request, broker invokes {@link #authorize(AuthorizableRequestContext, List)} to authorize
 *       actions performed by the request.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Authorizer implementation class may optionally implement @{@link org.apache.kafka.common.Reconfigurable}
 * to enable dynamic reconfiguration without restarting the broker.
 * <p>
 * <b>Threading model:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>All authorizer operations including authorization and ACL updates must be thread-safe.</li>
 *   <li>ACL update methods are asynchronous. Implementations with low update latency may return a
 *       completed future using {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture#completedFuture(Object)}.
 *       This ensures that the request will be handled synchronously by the caller without using a
 *       purgatory to wait for the result. If ACL updates require remote communication which may block,
 *       return a future that is completed asynchronously when the remote operation completes. This enables
 *       the caller to process other requests on the request threads without blocking.</li>
 *   <li>Any threads or thread pools used for processing remote operations asynchronously can be started during
 *       {@link #start(AuthorizerServerInfo)}. These threads must be shutdown during {@link Authorizer#close()}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
