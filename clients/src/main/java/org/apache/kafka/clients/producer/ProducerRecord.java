/**
 * A key/value pair to be sent to Kafka. This consists of a topic name to which the record is being sent, an optional
 * partition number, and an optional key and value.
 * <p>
 * If a valid partition number is specified that partition will be used when sending the record. If no partition is
 * specified but a key is present a partition will be chosen using a hash of the key. If neither key nor partition is
 * present a partition will be assigned in a round-robin fashion. Note that partition numbers are 0-indexed.
 * <p>
 * The record also has an associated timestamp. If the user did not provide a timestamp, the producer will stamp the
 * record with its current time. The timestamp eventually used by Kafka depends on the timestamp type configured for
 * the topic.
 * <li>
 * If the topic is configured to use {@link org.apache.kafka.common.record.TimestampType#CREATE_TIME CreateTime},
 * the timestamp in the producer record will be used by the broker.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * If the topic is configured to use {@link org.apache.kafka.common.record.TimestampType#LOG_APPEND_TIME LogAppendTime},
 * the timestamp in the producer record will be overwritten by the broker with the broker local time when it appends the
 * message to its log.
 * </li>
 * <p>
 * In either of the cases above, the timestamp that has actually been used will be returned to user in
 * {@link RecordMetadata}
