# Interactive Queries {#interactive-queries}

Interactive queries allow you to leverage the state of your application
from outside your application. The Kafka Streams enables your
applications to be queryable.

The full state of your application is typically 
[split across many distributed instances of your application](../architecture#streams_architecture_state), 
and across many state stores that are managed locally by these application instances.

![](streams-interactive-queries-03.png)

There are local and remote components to interactively querying the
state of your application.

Local state
:   An application instance can query the locally managed portion of the
    state and directly query its own local state stores. You can use the
    corresponding local data in other parts of your application code, as
    long as it doesn't require calling the Kafka Streams API. Querying
    state stores is always read-only to guarantee that the underlying
    state stores will never be mutated out-of-band (e.g., you cannot add
    new entries). State stores should only be mutated by the
    corresponding processor topology and the input data it operates on.
    For more information, see 
    [Querying local state stores for an app instance](#streams-developer-guide-interactive-queries-local-stores).

Remote state

:   To query the full state of your application, you must connect the
    various fragments of the state, including:
    -   query local state stores
    -   discover all running instances of your application in the
        network and their state stores
    -   communicate with these instances over the network (e.g., an RPC
        layer)
    
Connecting these fragments enables communication between instances
of the same app and communication from other applications for
interactive queries. For more information, see 
[Querying remote state stores for the entire app](#streams-developer-guide-interactive-queries-discovery).

Kafka Streams natively provides all of the required functionality for
interactively querying the state of your application, except if you want
to expose the full state of your application via interactive queries. To
allow application instances to communicate over the network, you must
add a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) layer to your application (e.g., REST
API).

This table shows the Kafka Streams native communication support for
various procedures.

| Procedure                                                 | Application instance | Entire application                 |

## Querying local state stores for an app instance {#querying-local-state-stores-for-an-app-instance}

A Kafka Streams application typically runs on multiple instances. The
state that is locally available on any given instance is only a subset
of the [application's entire state](../../architecture#streams-architecture-state). 
Querying the local stores on an instance will only return
data locally available on that particular instance.

The method `KafkaStreams#store(...)` finds
an application instance's local state stores by name and type.

![](streams-interactive-queries-api-01.png)
> Every application instance can directly query any of its local state stores.

The *name* of a state store is defined when you create the store. You
can create the store explicitly by using the Processor API or implicitly
by using stateful operations in the DSL.

The *type* of a state store is defined by
`QueryableStoreType`. You can access the
built-in types via the class `QueryableStoreTypes`. 
Kafka Streams currently has two built-in types:

-   A key-value store `QueryableStoreTypes#keyValueStore()`, see [Querying local key-value stores](#streams-developer-guide-interactive-queries-local-key-value-stores).
-   A window store `QueryableStoreTypes#windowStore()`, see [Querying local window stores](#streams-developer-guide-interactive-queries-local-window-stores).

You can also [implement your own QueryableStoreType](#streams-developer-guide-interactive-queries-custom-stores) 
as described in section [Querying local custom state stores](#streams-developer-guide-interactive-queries-custom-stores).

**Note**

Kafka Streams materializes one state store per stream partition. This
means your application will potentially manage many underlying state
stores. The API enables you to query all of the underlying stores
without having to know which partition the data is in.

### Querying local key-value stores {#querying-local-key-value-stores}

To query a local key-value store, you must first create a topology with
a key-value store. This example creates a key-value store named
"CountsKeyValueStore". This store will hold the latest count for any
word that is found on the topic "word-count-input".

```java line-numbers
Properties  props = ...;
StreamsBuilder builder = ...;
KStream<String, String> textLines = ...;

// Define the processing topology (here: WordCount)
KGroupedStream<String, String> groupedByWord = textLines
  .flatMapValues(value -> Arrays.asList(value.toLowerCase().split("\\W+")))
  .groupBy((key, word) -> word, Grouped.with(stringSerde, stringSerde));

// Create a key-value store named "CountsKeyValueStore" for the all-time word counts
groupedByWord.count(Materialized.<String, String, KeyValueStore<Bytes, byte[]>as("CountsKeyValueStore"));

// Start an instance of the topology
KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(builder, props);
streams.start();
```

After the application has started, you can get access to
"CountsKeyValueStore" and then query it via the
[ReadOnlyKeyValueStore](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/{{<param akDotVersion>}}/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/state/ReadOnlyKeyValueStore.java) API:

```java line-numbers
// Get the key-value store CountsKeyValueStore
ReadOnlyKeyValueStore<String, Long> keyValueStore =
    streams.store("CountsKeyValueStore", QueryableStoreTypes.keyValueStore());

// Get value by key
System.out.println("count for hello:" + keyValueStore.get("hello"));

// Get the values for a range of keys available in this application instance
KeyValueIterator<String, Long> range = keyValueStore.range("all", "streams");
while (range.hasNext()) {
  KeyValue<String, Long> next = range.next();
  System.out.println("count for " + next.key + ": " + next.value);
}

// Get the values for all of the keys available in this application instance
KeyValueIterator<String, Long> range = keyValueStore.all();
while (range.hasNext()) {
  KeyValue<String, Long> next = range.next();
  System.out.println("count for " + next.key + ": " + next.value);
}
```

You can also materialize the results of stateless operators by using the
overloaded methods that take a `queryableStoreName` as shown in the example below:

```java line-numbers
StreamsBuilder builder = ...;
KTable<String, Integer> regionCounts = ...;

// materialize the result of filtering corresponding to odd numbers
// the "queryableStoreName" can be subsequently queried.
KTable<String, Integer> oddCounts = numberLines.filter((region, count) -> (count % 2 != 0),
  Materialized.<String, Integer, KeyValueStore<Bytes, byte[]>as("queryableStoreName"));

// do not materialize the result of filtering corresponding to even numbers
// this means that these results will not be materialized and cannot be queried.
KTable<String, Integer> oddCounts = numberLines.filter((region, count) -> (count % 2 == 0));
```

### Querying local window stores {#querying-local-window-stores}

A window store will potentially have many results for any given key
because the key can be present in multiple windows. However, there is
only one result per window for a given key.

To query a local window store, you must first create a topology with a
window store. This example creates a window store named
"CountsWindowStore" that contains the counts for words in 1-minute
windows.

```java line-numbers
StreamsBuilder builder = ...;
KStream<String, String> textLines = ...;

// Define the processing topology (here: WordCount)
KGroupedStream<String, String> groupedByWord = textLines
  .flatMapValues(value -> Arrays.asList(value.toLowerCase().split("\\W+")))
  .groupBy((key, word) -> word, Grouped.with(stringSerde, stringSerde));

// Create a window state store named "CountsWindowStore" that contains the word counts for every minute
groupedByWord.windowedBy(TimeWindows.ofSizeWithNoGrace(Duration.ofSeconds(60)))
  .count(Materialized.<String, Long, WindowStore<Bytes, byte[]>as("CountsWindowStore"));
```

After the application has started, you can get access to
"CountsWindowStore" and then query it via the
[ReadOnlyWindowStore](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/{{<param akDotVersion>}}/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/state/ReadOnlyWindowStore.java) API:

```java line-numbers
// Get the window store named "CountsWindowStore"
ReadOnlyWindowStore<String, Long> windowStore =
    streams.store("CountsWindowStore", QueryableStoreTypes.windowStore());

// Fetch values for the key "world" for all of the windows available in this application instance.
// To get *all* available windows we fetch windows from the beginning of time until now.
Instant timeFrom = Instant.ofEpochMilli(0); // beginning of time = oldest available
Instant timeTo = Instant.now(); // now (in processing-time)
WindowStoreIterator<Long> iterator = windowStore.fetch("world", timeFrom, timeTo);
while (iterator.hasNext()) {
  KeyValue<Long, Long> next = iterator.next();
  long windowTimestamp = next.key;
  System.out.println("Count of 'world' @ time " + windowTimestamp + " is " + next.value);
}
```

### Querying local custom state stores {#querying-local-custom-state-stores}

**Note**

Only the [Processor API](../processor-api#streams-developer-guide-processor-api) supports custom state stores.

Before querying the custom state stores you must implement these interfaces:

-   Your custom state store must implement `StateStore`.
-   You must have an interface to represent the operations available on
    the store.
-   You must provide an implementation of `StoreBuilder` for creating instances of your store.
-   It is recommended that you provide an interface that restricts
    access to read-only operations. This prevents users of this API from
    mutating the state of your running Kafka Streams application
    out-of-band.

The class/interface hierarchy for your custom store might look something like:

```java line-numbers
public class MyCustomStore<K,V> implements StateStore, MyWriteableCustomStore<K,V> {
  // implementation of the actual store
}

// Read-write interface for MyCustomStore
public interface MyWriteableCustomStore<K,V> extends MyReadableCustomStore<K,V> {
  void write(K Key, V value);
}

// Read-only interface for MyCustomStore
public interface MyReadableCustomStore<K,V> {
  V read(K key);
}

public class MyCustomStoreBuilder implements StoreBuilder {
  // implementation of the supplier for MyCustomStore
}
```

To make this store queryable you must:

-   Provide an implementation of
    [QueryableStoreType](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/{{<param akDotVersion>}}/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/state/QueryableStoreType.java).
-   Provide a wrapper class that has access to all of the underlying
    instances of the store and is used for querying.

Here is how to implement `QueryableStoreType`:

```
public class MyCustomStoreType<K,V> implements QueryableStoreType<MyReadableCustomStore<K,V>> {

  // Only accept StateStores that are of type MyCustomStore
  public boolean accepts(final StateStore stateStore) {
    return stateStore instanceOf MyCustomStore;
  }

  public MyReadableCustomStore<K,V> create(final StateStoreProvider storeProvider, final String storeName) {
      return new MyCustomStoreTypeWrapper(storeProvider, storeName, this);
  }

}
```

A wrapper class is required because each instance of a Kafka Streams
application may run multiple stream tasks and manage multiple local
instances of a particular state store. The wrapper class hides this
complexity and lets you query a "logical" state store by name without
having to know about all of the underlying local instances of that state
store.

When implementing your wrapper class you must use the
[StateStoreProvider](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/{{<param akDotVersion>}}/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/state/internals/StateStoreProvider.java) interface to get access to the underlying instances of your
store. `StateStoreProvider#stores(String storeName, QueryableStoreType<T> queryableStoreType)` returns a `List` of state
stores with the given storeName and of the type as defined by
`queryableStoreType`.

Here is an example implementation of the wrapper follows (Java 8+):

```java line-numbers
// We strongly recommended implementing a read-only interface
// to restrict usage of the store to safe read operations!
public class MyCustomStoreTypeWrapper<K,V> implements MyReadableCustomStore<K,V> {

  private final QueryableStoreType<MyReadableCustomStore<K, V>> customStoreType;
  private final String storeName;
  private final StateStoreProvider provider;

  public CustomStoreTypeWrapper(final StateStoreProvider provider,
                              final String storeName,
                              final QueryableStoreType<MyReadableCustomStore<K, V>> customStoreType) {

    // ... assign fields ...
  }

  // Implement a safe read method
  @Override
  public V read(final K key) {
    // Get all the stores with storeName and of customStoreType
    final List<MyReadableCustomStore<K, V>> stores = provider.getStores(storeName, customStoreType);
    // Try and find the value for the given key
    final Optional<V> value = stores.stream().filter(store -> store.read(key) != null).findFirst();
    // Return the value if it exists
    return value.orElse(null);
  }

}
```

You can now find and query your custom store:

```java line-numbers
Topology topology = ...;
ProcessorSupplier processorSuppler = ...;

// Create CustomStoreSupplier for store name the-custom-store
MyCustomStoreBuilder customStoreBuilder = new MyCustomStoreBuilder("the-custom-store") //...;
// Add the source topic
topology.addSource("input", "inputTopic");
// Add a custom processor that reads from the source topic
topology.addProcessor("the-processor", processorSupplier, "input");
// Connect your custom state store to the custom processor above
topology.addStateStore(customStoreBuilder, "the-processor");

KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(topology, config);
streams.start();

// Get access to the custom store
MyReadableCustomStore<String,String> store = streams.store("the-custom-store", new MyCustomStoreType<String,String>());
// Query the store
String value = store.read("key");
```

## Querying remote state stores for the entire app {#querying-remote-state-stores-for-the-entire-app}

To query remote states for the entire app, you must expose the
application's full state to other applications, including applications
that are running on different machines.

For example, you have a Kafka Streams application that processes user
events in a multi-player video game, and you want to retrieve the latest
status of each user directly and display it in a mobile app. Here are
the required steps to make the full state of your application queryable:

1.  [Add an RPC layer to your application](#streams-developer-guide-interactive-queries-rpc-layer) so that the instances of your application can be
    interacted with via the network (e.g., a REST API, Thrift, a custom
    protocol, and so on). The instances must respond to interactive
    queries. You can follow the reference examples provided to get
    started.
2.  [Expose the RPC endpoints](#streams-developer-guide-interactive-queries-expose-rpc) of your application's instances via the
    `application.server` configuration
    setting of Kafka Streams. Because RPC endpoints must be unique
    within a network, each instance has its own value for this
    configuration setting. This makes an application instance
    discoverable by other instances.
3.  In the RPC layer, [discover remote application instances](#streams-developer-guide-interactive-queries-discover-app-instances-and-stores) 
    and their state stores and [query locally available state stores](#streams-developer-guide-interactive-queries-local-stores) 
    to make the full state of your application queryable. The
    remote application instances can forward queries to other app
    instances if a particular instance lacks the local data to respond
    to a query. The locally available state stores can directly respond
    to queries.

![](streams-interactive-queries-api-02.png)

> Discover any running instances of the same application as well as the
respective RPC endpoints they expose for interactive
queries

### Adding an RPC layer to your application {#adding-an-rpc-layer-to-your-application}

There are many ways to add an RPC layer. The only requirements are that
the RPC layer is embedded within the Kafka Streams application and that
it exposes an endpoint that other application instances and applications
can connect to.

### Exposing the RPC endpoints of your application {#exposing-the-rpc-endpoints-of-your-application}

To enable remote state store discovery in a distributed Kafka Streams
application, you must set the [configuration property](config-streams.html#streams-developer-guide-required-configs) 
in the config properties. The `application.server` property defines a unique `host:port` pair that points to the RPC endpoint of the respective
instance of a Kafka Streams application. The value of this configuration
property will vary across the instances of your application. When this
property is set, Kafka Streams will keep track of the RPC endpoint
information for every instance of an application, its state stores, and
assigned stream partitions through instances of
[StreamsMetadata](/{{< param akVersion >}}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/state/StreamsMetadata.html).

**Tip**

Consider leveraging the exposed RPC endpoints of your application for
further functionality, such as piggybacking additional inter-application
communication that goes beyond interactive queries.

This example shows how to configure and run a Kafka Streams application
that supports the discovery of its state stores.

```java line-numbers
Properties props = new Properties();
// Set the unique RPC endpoint of this application instance through which it
// can be interactively queried.  In a real application, the value would most
// probably not be hardcoded but derived dynamically.
String rpcEndpoint = "host1:4460";
props.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_SERVER_CONFIG, rpcEndpoint);
// ... further settings may follow here ...

StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();

KStream<String, String> textLines = builder.stream(stringSerde, stringSerde, "word-count-input");

final KGroupedStream<String, String> groupedByWord = textLines
    .flatMapValues(value -> Arrays.asList(value.toLowerCase().split("\\W+")))
    .groupBy((key, word) -> word, Grouped.with(stringSerde, stringSerde));

// This call to `count()` creates a state store named "word-count".
// The state store is discoverable and can be queried interactively.
groupedByWord.count(Materialized.<String, Long, KeyValueStore<Bytes, byte[]>as("word-count"));

// Start an instance of the topology
KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(builder, props);
streams.start();

// Then, create and start the actual RPC service for remote access to this
// application instance's local state stores.
//
// This service should be started on the same host and port as defined above by
// the property `StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_SERVER_CONFIG`.  The example below is
// fictitious, but we provide end-to-end demo applications (such as KafkaMusicExample)
// that showcase how to implement such a service to get you started.
MyRPCService rpcService = ...;
rpcService.listenAt(rpcEndpoint);
```

### Discovering and accessing application instances and their local state stores {#discovering-and-accessing-application-instances-and-their-local-state-stores}

The following methods return
[StreamsMetadata](/{{< param akVersion >}}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/state/StreamsMetadata.html) objects, 
which provide meta-information about application
instances such as their RPC endpoint and locally available state stores.

-   `KafkaStreams#allMetadata()`: find all
    instances of this application
-   `KafkaStreams#allMetadataForStore(String storeName)`: find those applications instances that manage
    local instances of the state store "storeName"
-   `KafkaStreams#metadataForKey(String storeName, K key, Serializer<K> keySerializer)`: using the default stream partitioning strategy,
    find the one application instance that holds the data for the given
    key in the given state store
-   `KafkaStreams#metadataForKey(String storeName, K key,`` `{.docutils
    .literal}`StreamPartitioner<K, ?> partitioner)`: using `partitioner`,
    find the one application instance that holds the data for the given
    key in the given state store

Attention

If `application.server` is not configured
for an application instance, then the above methods will not find any
[StreamsMetadata](/{{< param akVersion >}}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/state/StreamsMetadata.html) for it.

For example, we can now find the `StreamsMetadata` for the state store named "word-count" that we defined
in the code example shown in the previous section:

```java line-numbers
KafkaStreams streams = ...;
// Find all the locations of local instances of the state store named "word-count"
Collection<StreamsMetadata> wordCountHosts = streams.allMetadataForStore("word-count");

// For illustrative purposes, we assume using an HTTP client to talk to remote app instances.
HttpClient http = ...;

// Get the word count for word (aka key) 'alice': Approach 1
//
// We first find the one app instance that manages the count for 'alice' in its local state stores.
StreamsMetadata metadata = streams.metadataForKey("word-count", "alice", Serdes.String().serializer());
// Then, we query only that single app instance for the latest count of 'alice'.
// Note: The RPC URL shown below is fictitious and only serves to illustrate the idea.  Ultimately,
// the URL (or, in general, the method of communication) will depend on the RPC layer you opted to
// implement.  Again, we provide end-to-end demo applications (such as KafkaMusicExample) that showcase
// how to implement such an RPC layer.
Long result = http.getLong("http://" + metadata.host() + ":" + metadata.port() + "/word-count/alice");

// Get the word count for word (aka key) 'alice': Approach 2
//
// Alternatively, we could also choose (say) a brute-force approach where we query every app instance
// until we find the one that happens to know about 'alice'.
Optional<Long> result = streams.allMetadataForStore("word-count")
    .stream()
    .map(streamsMetadata -> {
        // Construct the (fictituous) full endpoint URL to query the current remote application instance
        String url = "http://" + streamsMetadata.host() + ":" + streamsMetadata.port() + "/word-count/alice";
        // Read and return the count for 'alice', if any.
        return http.getLong(url);
    })
    .filter(s -> s != null)
    .findFirst();
```

At this point the full state of the application is interactively
queryable:

-   You can discover the running instances of the application and the
    state stores they manage locally.
-   Through the RPC layer that was added to the application, you can
    communicate with these application instances over the network and
    query them for locally available state.
-   The application instances are able to serve such queries because
    they can directly query their own local state stores and respond via
    the RPC layer.
-   Collectively, this allows us to query the full state of the entire
    application.

To see an end-to-end application with interactive queries, review the
[demo applications](#streams-developer-guide-interactive-queries-demos).
