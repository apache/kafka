/**
 * This is a helper class which makes blocking methods with a timeout easier to implement.
 * In particular it enables use cases where a high-level blocking call with a timeout is
 * composed of several lower level calls, each of which has their own respective timeouts. The idea
 * is to create a single timer object for the high level timeout and carry it along to
 * all of the lower level methods. This class also handles common problems such as integer overflow.
 * This class also ensures monotonic updates to the timer even if the underlying clock is subject
 * to non-monotonic behavior. For example, the remaining time returned by {@link #remainingMs()} is
 * guaranteed to decrease monotonically until it hits zero.
 *
 * Note that it is up to the caller to ensure progress of the timer using one of the
 * {@link #update()} methods or {@link #sleep(long)}. The timer will cache the current time and
 * return it indefinitely until the timer has been updated. This allows the caller to limit
 * unnecessary system calls and update the timer only when needed. For example, a timer which is
 * waiting a request sent through the {@link org.apache.kafka.clients.NetworkClient} should call
 * {@link #update()} following each blocking call to
 * {@link org.apache.kafka.clients.NetworkClient#poll(long, long)}.
 *
 * A typical usage might look something like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     Time time = Time.SYSTEM;
 *     Timer timer = time.timer(500);
 *
 *     while (!conditionSatisfied() && timer.notExpired) {
 *         client.poll(timer.remainingMs(), timer.currentTimeMs());
 *         timer.update();
 *     }
 * </pre>
