/**
 * The round robin assignor lays out all the available partitions and all the available consumers. It
 * then proceeds to do a round robin assignment from partition to consumer. If the subscriptions of all consumer
 * instances are identical, then the partitions will be uniformly distributed. (i.e., the partition ownership counts
 * will be within a delta of exactly one across all consumers.)
 *
 * For example, suppose there are two consumers C0 and C1, two topics t0 and t1, and each topic has 3 partitions,
 * resulting in partitions t0p0, t0p1, t0p2, t1p0, t1p1, and t1p2.
 *
 * The assignment will be:
 * C0: [t0p0, t0p2, t1p1]
 * C1: [t0p1, t1p0, t1p2]
 *
 * When subscriptions differ across consumer instances, the assignment process still considers each
 * consumer instance in round robin fashion but skips over an instance if it is not subscribed to
 * the topic. Unlike the case when subscriptions are identical, this can result in imbalanced
 * assignments. For example, we have three consumers C0, C1, C2, and three topics t0, t1, t2,
 * with 1, 2, and 3 partitions, respectively. Therefore, the partitions are t0p0, t1p0, t1p1, t2p0,
 * t2p1, t2p2. C0 is subscribed to t0; C1 is subscribed to t0, t1; and C2 is subscribed to t0, t1, t2.
 *
 * Tha assignment will be:
 * C0: [t0p0]
 * C1: [t1p0]
 * C2: [t1p1, t2p0, t2p1, t2p2]
