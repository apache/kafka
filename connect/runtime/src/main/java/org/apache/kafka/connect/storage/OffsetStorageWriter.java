/**
 * <p>
 * OffsetStorageWriter is a buffered writer that wraps the simple OffsetBackingStore interface.
 * It maintains a copy of the key-value data in memory and buffers writes. It allows you to take
 * a snapshot, which can then be asynchronously flushed to the backing store while new writes
 * continue to be processed. This allows Kafka Connect to process offset commits in the background
 * while continuing to process messages.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Connect uses an OffsetStorage implementation to save state about the current progress of
 * source (import to Kafka) jobs, which may have many input partitions and "offsets" may not be as
 * simple as they are for Kafka partitions or files. Offset storage is not required for sink jobs
 * because they can use Kafka's native offset storage (or the sink data store can handle offset
 * storage to achieve exactly once semantics).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Both partitions and offsets are generic data objects. This allows different connectors to use
 * whatever representation they need, even arbitrarily complex records. These are translated
 * internally into the serialized form the OffsetBackingStore uses.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that this only provides write functionality. This is intentional to ensure stale data is
 * never read. Offset data should only be read during startup or reconfiguration of a task. By
 * always serving those requests by reading the values from the backing store, we ensure we never
 * accidentally use stale data. (One example of how this can occur: a task is processing input
 * partition A, writing offsets; reconfiguration causes partition A to be reassigned elsewhere;
 * reconfiguration causes partition A to be reassigned to this node, but now the offset data is out
 * of date). Since these offsets are created and managed by the connector itself, there's no way
 * for the offset management layer to know which keys are "owned" by which tasks at any given
 * time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is thread-safe.
 * </p>
