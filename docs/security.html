    <h3><a id="security_overview" href="#security_overview">7.1 Security Overview</a></h3>
    In release 0.9.0.0, the Kafka community added a number of features that, used either separately or together, increases security in a Kafka cluster. The following security measures are currently supported:
    <ol>
        <li>Authentication of connections to brokers from clients (producers and consumers), other brokers and tools, using either SSL or SASL. Kafka supports the following SASL mechanisms:
        <ul>
            <li>SASL/GSSAPI (Kerberos) - starting at version 0.9.0.0</li>
            <li>SASL/PLAIN - starting at version 0.10.0.0</li>
            <li>SASL/SCRAM-SHA-256 and SASL/SCRAM-SHA-512 - starting at version 0.10.2.0</li>
            <li>SASL/OAUTHBEARER - starting at version 2.0</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Authentication of connections from brokers to ZooKeeper</li>
        <li>Encryption of data transferred between brokers and clients, between brokers, or between brokers and tools using SSL (Note that there is a performance degradation when SSL is enabled, the magnitude of which depends on the CPU type and the JVM implementation.)</li>
        <li>Authorization of read / write operations by clients</li>
        <li>Authorization is pluggable and integration with external authorization services is supported</li>
    </ol>

    It's worth noting that security is optional - non-secured clusters are supported, as well as a mix of authenticated, unauthenticated, encrypted and non-encrypted clients.

    The guides below explain how to configure and use the security features in both clients and brokers.

    <h3><a id="security_ssl" href="#security_ssl">7.2 Encryption and Authentication using SSL</a></h3>
    Apache Kafka allows clients to connect over SSL. By default, SSL is disabled but can be turned on as needed.

    <ol>
        <li><h4><a id="security_ssl_key" href="#security_ssl_key">Generate SSL key and certificate for each Kafka broker</a></h4>
            The first step of deploying one or more brokers with the SSL support is to generate the key and the certificate for each machine in the cluster. You can use Java's keytool utility to accomplish this task.
            We will generate the key into a temporary keystore initially so that we can export and sign it later with CA.
            <pre class="brush: bash;">
            keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -validity {validity} -genkey -keyalg RSA</pre>

            You need to specify two parameters in the above command:
            <ol>
                <li>keystore: the keystore file that stores the certificate. The keystore file contains the private key of the certificate; therefore, it needs to be kept safely.</li>
                <li>validity: the valid time of the certificate in days.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>

        <h5><a id="security_confighostname" href="#security_confighostname">Configuring Host Name Verification</a></h5>
        From Kafka version 2.0.0 onwards, host name verification of servers is enabled by default for client connections
        as well as inter-broker connections to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Server host name verification may be disabled
        by setting <code>ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm</code> to an empty string. For example,
        <pre class="brush: text;">	ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm=</pre>
        For dynamically configured broker listeners, hostname verification may be disabled using <code>kafka-configs.sh</code>.
        For example,
        <pre class="brush: text;">
        bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9093 --entity-type brokers --entity-name 0 --alter --add-config "listener.name.internal.ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm="
        </pre>

        For older versions of Kafka, <code>ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm</code> is not defined by default, so host name
        verification is not performed. The property should be set to <code>HTTPS</code> to enable host name verification.

        <pre class="brush: text;">	ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm=HTTPS </pre>

        Host name verification must be enabled to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks if server endpoints are not validated
        externally.

        <h5><a id="security_configcerthostname" href="#security_configcerthstname">Configuring Host Name In Certificates</a></h5>
        If host name verification is enabled, clients will verify the server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) against one of
        the following two fields:
        <ol>
            <li>Common Name (CN)
            <li>Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
        </ol>
        <br>
        Both fields are valid, RFC-2818 recommends the use of SAN however. SAN is also more flexible, allowing for multiple DNS entries to be declared. Another advantage is that the CN can be set to a more meaningful value for authorization purposes. To add a SAN field  append the following argument <code> -ext SAN=DNS:{FQDN} </code> to the keytool command:
        <pre class="brush: bash;">
        keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -validity {validity} -genkey -keyalg RSA -ext SAN=DNS:{FQDN}
        </pre>
        The following command can be run afterwards to verify the contents of the generated certificate:
        <pre class="brush: bash;">
        keytool -list -v -keystore server.keystore.jks
        </pre>
        </li>
        <li><h4><a id="security_ssl_ca" href="#security_ssl_ca">Creating your own CA</a></h4>
            After the first step, each machine in the cluster has a public-private key pair, and a certificate to identify the machine. The certificate, however, is unsigned, which means that an attacker can create such a certificate to pretend to be any machine.<p>
            Therefore, it is important to prevent forged certificates by signing them for each machine in the cluster. A certificate authority (CA) is responsible for signing certificates. CA works likes a government that issues passports—the government stamps (signs) each passport so that the passport becomes difficult to forge. Other governments verify the stamps to ensure the passport is authentic. Similarly, the CA signs the certificates, and the cryptography guarantees that a signed certificate is computationally difficult to forge. Thus, as long as the CA is a genuine and trusted authority, the clients have high assurance that they are connecting to the authentic machines.
            <pre class="brush: bash;">
            openssl req -new -x509 -keyout ca-key -out ca-cert -days 365</pre>

            The generated CA is simply a public-private key pair and certificate, and it is intended to sign other certificates.<br>

            The next step is to add the generated CA to the **clients' truststore** so that the clients can trust this CA:
            <pre class="brush: bash;">
            keytool -keystore client.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert</pre>

            <b>Note:</b> If you configure the Kafka brokers to require client authentication by setting ssl.client.auth to be "requested" or "required" on the <a href="#config_broker">Kafka brokers config</a> then you must provide a truststore for the Kafka brokers as well and it should have all the CA certificates that clients' keys were signed by.
            <pre class="brush: bash;">
            keytool -keystore server.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert</pre>

            In contrast to the keystore in step 1 that stores each machine's own identity, the truststore of a client stores all the certificates that the client should trust. Importing a certificate into one's truststore also means trusting all certificates that are signed by that certificate. As the analogy above, trusting the government (CA) also means trusting all passports (certificates) that it has issued. This attribute is called the chain of trust, and it is particularly useful when deploying SSL on a large Kafka cluster. You can sign all certificates in the cluster with a single CA, and have all machines share the same truststore that trusts the CA. That way all machines can authenticate all other machines.</li>

        <li><h4><a id="security_ssl_signing" href="#security_ssl_signing">Signing the certificate</a></h4>
            The next step is to sign all certificates generated by step 1 with the CA generated in step 2. First, you need to export the certificate from the keystore:
            <pre class="brush: bash;">
            keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -certreq -file cert-file</pre>

            Then sign it with the CA:
            <pre class="brush: bash;">
            openssl x509 -req -CA ca-cert -CAkey ca-key -in cert-file -out cert-signed -days {validity} -CAcreateserial -passin pass:{ca-password}</pre>

            Finally, you need to import both the certificate of the CA and the signed certificate into the keystore:
            <pre class="brush: bash;">
            keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert
            keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -import -file cert-signed</pre>

            The definitions of the parameters are the following:
            <ol>
                <li>keystore: the location of the keystore</li>
                <li>ca-cert: the certificate of the CA</li>
                <li>ca-key: the private key of the CA</li>
                <li>ca-password: the passphrase of the CA</li>
                <li>cert-file: the exported, unsigned certificate of the server</li>
                <li>cert-signed: the signed certificate of the server</li>
            </ol>

            Here is an example of a bash script with all above steps. Note that one of the commands assumes a password of `test1234`, so either use that password or edit the command before running it.
                <pre>
            #!/bin/bash
            #Step 1
            keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -validity 365 -keyalg RSA -genkey
            #Step 2
            openssl req -new -x509 -keyout ca-key -out ca-cert -days 365
            keytool -keystore server.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert
            keytool -keystore client.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert
            #Step 3
            keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -certreq -file cert-file
            openssl x509 -req -CA ca-cert -CAkey ca-key -in cert-file -out cert-signed -days 365 -CAcreateserial -passin pass:test1234
            keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert
            keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -import -file cert-signed</pre></li>
        <li><h4><a id="security_configbroker" href="#security_configbroker">Configuring Kafka Brokers</a></h4>
            Kafka Brokers support listening for connections on multiple ports.
            We need to configure the following property in server.properties, which must have one or more comma-separated values:
            <pre>listeners</pre>

            If SSL is not enabled for inter-broker communication (see below for how to enable it), both PLAINTEXT and SSL ports will be necessary.
            <pre class="brush: text;">
            listeners=PLAINTEXT://host.name:port,SSL://host.name:port</pre>

            Following SSL configs are needed on the broker side
            <pre class="brush: text;">
            ssl.keystore.location=/var/private/ssl/server.keystore.jks
            ssl.keystore.password=test1234
            ssl.key.password=test1234
            ssl.truststore.location=/var/private/ssl/server.truststore.jks
            ssl.truststore.password=test1234</pre>

            Note: ssl.truststore.password is technically optional but highly recommended. If a password is not set access to the truststore is still available, but integrity checking is disabled.

            Optional settings that are worth considering:
            <ol>
                <li>ssl.client.auth=none ("required" => client authentication is required, "requested" => client authentication is requested and client without certs can still connect. The usage of "requested" is discouraged as it provides a false sense of security and misconfigured clients will still connect successfully.)</li>
                <li>ssl.cipher.suites (Optional). A cipher suite is a named combination of authentication, encryption, MAC and key exchange algorithm used to negotiate the security settings for a network connection using TLS or SSL network protocol. (Default is an empty list)</li>
                <li>ssl.enabled.protocols=TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1,TLSv1 (list out the SSL protocols that you are going to accept from clients. Do note that SSL is deprecated in favor of TLS and using SSL in production is not recommended)</li>
                <li>ssl.keystore.type=JKS</li>
                <li>ssl.truststore.type=JKS</li>
                <li>ssl.secure.random.implementation=SHA1PRNG</li>
            </ol>
            If you want to enable SSL for inter-broker communication, add the following to the server.properties file (it defaults to PLAINTEXT)
            <pre>
            security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL</pre>

            <p>
            Due to import regulations in some countries, the Oracle implementation limits the strength of cryptographic algorithms available by default. If stronger algorithms are needed (for example, AES with 256-bit keys), the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files</a> must be obtained and installed in the JDK/JRE. See the
            <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html">JCA Providers Documentation</a> for more information.
            </p>

            <p>
            The JRE/JDK will have a default pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) that is used for cryptography operations, so it is not required to configure the
            implementation used with the <pre>ssl.secure.random.implementation</pre>. However, there are performance issues with some implementations (notably, the
            default chosen on Linux systems, <pre>NativePRNG</pre>, utilizes a global lock). In cases where performance of SSL connections becomes an issue,
            consider explicitly setting the implementation to be used. The <pre>SHA1PRNG</pre> implementation is non-blocking, and has shown very good performance
            characteristics under heavy load (50 MB/sec of produced messages, plus replication traffic, per-broker).
            </p>

            Once you start the broker you should be able to see in the server.log
            <pre>
            with addresses: PLAINTEXT -> EndPoint(192.168.64.1,9092,PLAINTEXT),SSL -> EndPoint(192.168.64.1,9093,SSL)</pre>

            To check quickly if  the server keystore and truststore are setup properly you can run the following command
            <pre>openssl s_client -debug -connect localhost:9093 -tls1</pre> (Note: TLSv1 should be listed under ssl.enabled.protocols)<br>
            In the output of this command you should see server's certificate:
            <pre>
            -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
            {variable sized random bytes}
            -----END CERTIFICATE-----
            subject=/C=US/ST=CA/L=Santa Clara/O=org/OU=org/CN=Sriharsha Chintalapani
            issuer=/C=US/ST=CA/L=Santa Clara/O=org/OU=org/CN=kafka/emailAddress=test@test.com</pre>
            If the certificate does not show up or if there are any other error messages then your keystore is not setup properly.</li>

        <li><h4><a id="security_configclients" href="#security_configclients">Configuring Kafka Clients</a></h4>
            SSL is supported only for the new Kafka Producer and Consumer, the older API is not supported. The configs for SSL will be the same for both producer and consumer.<br>
            If client authentication is not required in the broker, then the following is a minimal configuration example:
            <pre class="brush: text;">
            security.protocol=SSL
            ssl.truststore.location=/var/private/ssl/client.truststore.jks
            ssl.truststore.password=test1234</pre>

            Note: ssl.truststore.password is technically optional but highly recommended. If a password is not set access to the truststore is still available, but integrity checking is disabled.

            If client authentication is required, then a keystore must be created like in step 1 and the following must also be configured:
            <pre class="brush: text;">
            ssl.keystore.location=/var/private/ssl/client.keystore.jks
            ssl.keystore.password=test1234
            ssl.key.password=test1234</pre>
			
            Other configuration settings that may also be needed depending on our requirements and the broker configuration:
                <ol>
                    <li>ssl.provider (Optional). The name of the security provider used for SSL connections. Default value is the default security provider of the JVM.</li>
                    <li>ssl.cipher.suites (Optional). A cipher suite is a named combination of authentication, encryption, MAC and key exchange algorithm used to negotiate the security settings for a network connection using TLS or SSL network protocol.</li>
                    <li>ssl.enabled.protocols=TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1,TLSv1. It should list at least one of the protocols configured on the broker side</li>
                    <li>ssl.truststore.type=JKS</li>
                    <li>ssl.keystore.type=JKS</li>
                </ol>
    <br>
            Examples using console-producer and console-consumer:
            <pre class="brush: bash;">
            kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9093 --topic test --producer.config client-ssl.properties
            kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9093 --topic test --consumer.config client-ssl.properties</pre>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
    <li><h4><a id="security_sasl_jaasconfig" href="#security_sasl_jaasconfig">JAAS configuration</a></h4>
    <p>Kafka uses the Java Authentication and Authorization Service
    (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jaas/JAASRefGuide.html">JAAS</a>)
    for SASL configuration.</p>

        <li><h5><a id="security_jaas_broker"
            href="#security_jaas_broker">JAAS configuration for Kafka brokers</a></h5>

            <p><tt>KafkaServer</tt> is the section name in the JAAS file used by each
            KafkaServer/Broker. This section provides SASL configuration options
            for the broker including any SASL client connections made by the broker
            for inter-broker communication. If multiple listeners are configured to use
            SASL, the section name may be prefixed with the listener name in lower-case
            followed by a period, e.g. <tt>sasl_ssl.KafkaServer</tt>.</p>

            <p><tt>Client</tt> section is used to authenticate a SASL connection with
            zookeeper. It also allows the brokers to set SASL ACL on zookeeper
            nodes which locks these nodes down so that only the brokers can
            modify it. It is necessary to have the same principal name across all
            brokers. If you want to use a section name other than Client, set the
            system property <tt>zookeeper.sasl.clientconfig</tt> to the appropriate
            name (<i>e.g.</i>, <tt>-Dzookeeper.sasl.clientconfig=ZkClient</tt>).</p>

            <p>ZooKeeper uses "zookeeper" as the service name by default. If you
            want to change this, set the system property
            <tt>zookeeper.sasl.client.username</tt> to the appropriate name
            (<i>e.g.</i>, <tt>-Dzookeeper.sasl.client.username=zk</tt>).</p></li>

            <p>Brokers may also configure JAAS using the broker configuration property <code>sasl.jaas.config</code>.
            The property name must be prefixed with the listener prefix including the SASL mechanism,
            i.e. <code>listener.name.{listenerName}.{saslMechanism}.sasl.jaas.config</code>. Only one
            login module may be specified in the config value. If multiple mechanisms are configured on a
            listener, configs must be provided for each mechanism using the listener and mechanism prefix.
            For example,
                    <pre class="brush: text;">
        listener.name.sasl_ssl.scram-sha-256.sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.scram.ScramLoginModule required \
            username="admin" \

            user_admin="admin-secret" \
            user_alice="alice-secret";</pre>

            If JAAS configuration is defined at different levels, the order of precedence used is:
            <ul>
              <li>Broker configuration property <code>listener.name.{listenerName}.{saslMechanism}.sasl.jaas.config</code></li>
              <li><code>{listenerName}.KafkaServer</code> section of static JAAS configuration</code></li>
              <li><code>KafkaServer</code> section of static JAAS configuration</code></li>
            </ul>
            Note that ZooKeeper JAAS config may only be configured using static JAAS configuration.

            If your organization is already using a Kerberos server (for example, by using Active Directory), there is no need to install a new server just for Kafka. Otherwise you will need to install one, your Linux vendor likely has packages for Kerberos and a short guide on how to install and configure it (<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kerberos">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Managing_Smart_Cards/installing-kerberos.html">Redhat</a>). Note that if you are using Oracle Java, you will need to download JCE policy files for your Java version and copy them to $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security.</li>
            <li><b>Create Kerberos Principals</b><br>
            If you are using the organization's Kerberos or Active Directory server, ask your Kerberos administrator for a principal for each Kafka broker in your cluster and for every operating system user that will access Kafka with Kerberos authentication (via clients and tools).</br>
            If you have installed your own Kerberos, you will need to create these principals yourself using the following commands:
                <pre class="brush: bash;">
        sudo /usr/sbin/kadmin.local -q 'addprinc -randkey kafka/{hostname}@{REALM}'

        Client {

        };</pre>

            </li>
            <tt>KafkaServer</tt> section in the JAAS file tells the broker which principal to use and the location of the keytab where this principal is stored. It
            allows the broker to login using the keytab specified in this section. See <a href="#security_sasl_brokernotes">notes</a> for more details on Zookeeper SASL configuration.
            <li>Pass the JAAS and optionally the krb5 file locations as JVM parameters to each Kafka broker (see <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jgss/tutorials/KerberosReq.html">here</a> for more details):

            <li>Make sure the keytabs configured in the JAAS file are readable by the operating system user who is starting kafka broker.</li>
            <li>Configure SASL port and SASL mechanisms in server.properties as described <a href="#security_sasl_brokerconfig">here</a>. For example:

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Clients (producers, consumers, connect workers, etc) will authenticate to the cluster with their
                    own principal (usually with the same name as the user running the client), so obtain or create
                    these principals as needed. Then configure the JAAS configuration property for each client.
                    Different clients within a JVM may run as different users by specifiying different principals.
                    The property <code>sasl.jaas.config</code> in producer.properties or consumer.properties describes
                    how clients like producer and consumer can connect to the Kafka Broker. The following is an example
                    configuration for a client using a keytab (recommended for long-running processes):

        keyTab="/etc/security/keytabs/kafka_client.keytab" \
        principal="kafka-client-1@EXAMPLE.COM";</pre>

                   For command-line utilities like kafka-console-consumer or kafka-console-producer, kinit can be used
                   along with "useTicketCache=true" as in:

                the passwords for all users that connect to the broker and the broker validates all client connections including

            <li>The default implementation of SASL/PLAIN in Kafka specifies usernames and passwords in the JAAS configuration file as shown
                <a href="#security_sasl_plain_brokerconfig">here</a>. To avoid storing passwords on disk, you can plug in your own implementation of
                <code>javax.security.auth.spi.LoginModule</code> that provides usernames and passwords from an external source. The login module implementation should
                provide username as the public credential and password as the private credential of the <code>Subject</code>. The default implementation
                <code>org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule</code> can be used as an example.</li>
            <li>In production systems, external authentication servers may implement password authentication. Kafka brokers can be integrated with these servers by adding

        <p>Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) is a family of SASL mechanisms that
        addresses the security concerns with traditional mechanisms that perform username/password authentication
        like PLAIN and DIGEST-MD5. The mechanism is defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802">RFC 5802</a>.
        Kafka supports <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7677">SCRAM-SHA-256</a> and SCRAM-SHA-512 which
        can be used with TLS to perform secure authentication. The username is used as the authenticated

        <p>The SCRAM implementation in Kafka uses Zookeeper as credential store. Credentials can be created in
        Zookeeper using <tt>kafka-configs.sh</tt>. For each SCRAM mechanism enabled, credentials must be created
        by adding a config with the mechanism name. Credentials for inter-broker communication must be created
        before Kafka brokers are started. Client credentials may be created and updated dynamically and updated
        credentials will be used to authenticate new connections.</p>
        <p>Create SCRAM credentials for user <i>alice</i> with password <i>alice-secret</i>:
        <pre class="brush: bash;">
    > bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --alter --add-config 'SCRAM-SHA-256=[iterations=8192,password=alice-secret],SCRAM-SHA-512=[password=alice-secret]' --entity-type users --entity-name alice
        </pre>
        <p>The default iteration count of 4096 is used if iterations are not specified. A random salt is created
        and the SCRAM identity consisting of salt, iterations, StoredKey and ServerKey are stored in Zookeeper.
        See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802">RFC 5802</a> for details on SCRAM identity and the individual fields.
        <p>The following examples also require a user <i>admin</i> for inter-broker communication which can be created using:
        <pre class="brush: bash;">
    > bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --alter --add-config 'SCRAM-SHA-256=[password=admin-secret],SCRAM-SHA-512=[password=admin-secret]' --entity-type users --entity-name admin
        </pre>
        <p>Existing credentials may be listed using the <i>--describe</i> option:
        <pre class="brush: bash;">
    > bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --describe --entity-type users --entity-name alice
        </pre>
        <p>Credentials may be deleted for one or more SCRAM mechanisms using the <i>--delete</i> option:
        <pre class="brush: bash;">
    > bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --alter --delete-config 'SCRAM-SHA-512' --entity-type users --entity-name alice

            is suitable for production use in installations where Zookeeper is secure and on a private network.</li>
            <li>Kafka supports only the strong hash functions SHA-256 and SHA-512 with a minimum iteration count

    </li>

    <li><h4><a id="security_delegation_token" href="#security_delegation_token">Authentication using Delegation Tokens</a></h4>
        <p>Delegation token based authentication is a lightweight authentication mechanism to complement existing SASL/SSL
            methods. Delegation tokens are shared secrets between kafka brokers and clients. Delegation tokens will help processing
            frameworks to distribute the workload to available workers in a secure environment without the added cost of distributing
            Kerberos TGT/keytabs or keystores when 2-way SSL is used. See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-48+Delegation+token+support+for+Kafka">KIP-48</a>
            for more details.</p>

        <p>Typical steps for delegation token usage are:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>User authenticates with the Kafka cluster via SASL or SSL, and obtains a delegation token. This can be done
            using AdminClient APIs or using <tt>kafka-delegation-token.sh</tt> script.</li>
        <li>User securely passes the delegation token to Kafka clients for authenticating with the Kafka cluster.</li>
        <li>Token owner/renewer can renew/expire the delegation tokens.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
        <li><h5><a id="security_token_management" href="#security_token_management">Token Management</a></h5>
        <p> A master key/secret is used to generate and verify delegation tokens. This is supplied using config
            option <tt>delegation.token.master.key</tt>. Same secret key must be configured across all the brokers.
            If the secret is not set or set to empty string, brokers will disable the delegation token authentication.</p>

        <p>In current implementation, token details are stored in Zookeeper and is suitable for use in Kafka installations where
            Zookeeper is on a private network. Also currently,  master key/secret is stored as plain text in server.properties
            config file. We intend to make these configurable in a future Kafka release.</p>

        <p>A token has a current life, and a maximum renewable life. By default, tokens must be renewed once every 24 hours
            for up to 7 days. These can be configured using <tt>delegation.token.expiry.time.ms</tt>
            and <tt>delegation.token.max.lifetime.ms</tt> config options.</p>

        <p>Tokens can also be cancelled explicitly.  If a token is not renewed by the token’s expiration time or if token
            is beyond the max life time, it will be deleted from all broker caches as well as from zookeeper.</p>
        </li>

        <li><h5><a id="security_sasl_create_tokens" href="#security_sasl_create_tokens">Creating Delegation Tokens</a></h5>
        <p>Tokens can be created by using AdminClient APIs or using <tt>kafka-delegation-token.sh</tt> script.
            Delegation token requests (create/renew/expire/describe) should be issued only on SASL or SSL authenticated channels.
            Tokens can not be requests if the initial authentication is done through delegation token.
            <tt>kafka-delegation-token.sh</tt> script examples are given below.</p>
        <p>Create a delegation token:
        <pre class="brush: bash;">
    > bin/kafka-delegation-tokens.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create   --max-life-time-period -1 --command-config client.properties --renewer-principal User:user1
        </pre>
        <p>Renew a delegation token:
        <pre class="brush: bash;">
    > bin/kafka-delegation-tokens.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --renew    --renew-time-period -1 --command-config client.properties --hmac ABCDEFGHIJK
        </pre>
        <p>Expire a delegation token:
        <pre class="brush: bash;">
    > bin/kafka-delegation-tokens.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --expire   --expiry-time-period -1   --command-config client.properties  --hmac ABCDEFGHIJK
        </pre>
        <p>Existing tokens can be described using the --describe option:
        <pre class="brush: bash;">
    > bin/kafka-delegation-tokens.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --command-config client.properties  --owner-principal User:user1
        </pre>
        </li>
        <li><h5><a id="security_token_authentication" href="#security_token_authentication">Token Authentication</a></h5>
            <p>Delegation token authentication piggybacks on the current SASL/SCRAM authentication mechanism. We must enable
                SASL/SCRAM mechanism on Kafka cluster as described in <a href="#security_sasl_scram">here</a>.</p>

             <p>Configuring Kafka Clients:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Configure the JAAS configuration property for each client in producer.properties or consumer.properties.
                The login module describes how the clients like producer and consumer can connect to the Kafka Broker.
	        The following is an example configuration for a client for the token authentication:
                <pre class="brush: text;">
   sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.scram.ScramLoginModule required \
        username="tokenID123" \
        password="lAYYSFmLs4bTjf+lTZ1LCHR/ZZFNA==" \
        tokenauth="true";</pre>

                <p>The options <tt>username</tt> and <tt>password</tt> are used by clients to configure the token id and
                    token HMAC. And the option <tt>tokenauth</tt> is used to indicate the server about token authentication.
                    In this example, clients connect to the broker using token id: <i>tokenID123</i>. Different clients within a
                    JVM may connect using different tokens by specifying different token details in <code>sasl.jaas.config</code>.</p>

                <p>JAAS configuration for clients may alternatively be specified as a JVM parameter similar to brokers
                as described <a href="#security_client_staticjaas">here</a>. Clients use the login section named
                <tt>KafkaClient</tt>. This option allows only one user for all client connections from a JVM.</p></li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li><h5><a id="security_token_secret_rotation" href="#security_token_secret_rotation">Procedure to manually rotate the secret:</a></h5>
            <p>We require a re-deployment when the secret needs to be rotated. During this process, already connected clients
                will continue to work. But any new connection requests and renew/expire requests with old tokens can fail. Steps are given below.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Expire all existing tokens.</li>
                <li>Rotate the secret by rolling upgrade, and</li>
                <li>Generate new tokens</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We intend to automate this in a future Kafka release.</p>
        </li>

        <li><h5><a id="security_token_notes" href="#security_token_notes">Notes on Delegation Tokens</a></h5>
            <ul>
            <li>Currently, we only allow a user to create delegation token for that user only. Owner/Renewers can renew or expire tokens.
                Owner/renewers can always describe their own tokens. To describe others tokens, we need to add DESCRIBE permission on Token Resource.</li>
            </ul>

        </ol>
    </li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a id="security_authz" href="#security_authz">7.4 Authorization and ACLs</a></h3>
    Kafka ships with a pluggable Authorizer and an out-of-box authorizer implementation that uses zookeeper to store all the acls. The Authorizer is configured by setting <code>authorizer.class.name</code> in server.properties. To enable the out of the box implementation use:
    <pre>authorizer.class.name=kafka.security.auth.SimpleAclAuthorizer</pre>
    Kafka acls are defined in the general format of "Principal P is [Allowed/Denied] Operation O From Host H On Resource R". You can read more about the acl structure on KIP-11. In order to add, remove or list acls you can use the Kafka authorizer CLI. By default, if a Resource R has no associated acls, no one other than super users is allowed to access R. If you want to change that behavior, you can include the following in server.properties.
    <pre>allow.everyone.if.no.acl.found=true</pre>
    One can also add super users in server.properties like the following (note that the delimiter is semicolon since SSL user names may contain comma).
    <pre>super.users=User:Bob;User:Alice</pre>
    By default, the SSL user name will be of the form "CN=writeuser,OU=Unknown,O=Unknown,L=Unknown,ST=Unknown,C=Unknown". One can change that by setting a customized PrincipalBuilder in server.properties like the following.
    <pre>principal.builder.class=CustomizedPrincipalBuilderClass</pre>
    By default, the SASL user name will be the primary part of the Kerberos principal. One can change that by setting <code>sasl.kerberos.principal.to.local.rules</code> to a customized rule in server.properties.
    The format of <code>sasl.kerberos.principal.to.local.rules</code> is a list where each rule works in the same way as the auth_to_local in <a href="http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html">Kerberos configuration file (krb5.conf)</a>. This also support additional lowercase rule, to force the translated result to be all lower case. This is done by adding a "/L" to the end of the rule. check below formats for syntax.
    Each rules starts with RULE: and contains an expression as the following formats. See the kerberos documentation for more details.
    <pre>
        RULE:[n:string](regexp)s/pattern/replacement/
        RULE:[n:string](regexp)s/pattern/replacement/g
        RULE:[n:string](regexp)s/pattern/replacement//L
        RULE:[n:string](regexp)s/pattern/replacement/g/L
    </pre>

    An example of adding a rule to properly translate user@MYDOMAIN.COM to user while also keeping the default rule in place is:
    <pre>sasl.kerberos.principal.to.local.rules=RULE:[1:$1@$0](.*@MYDOMAIN.COM)s/@.*//,DEFAULT</pre>

    <h4><a id="security_authz_examples" href="#security_authz_examples">Examples</a></h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Adding Acls</b><br>
    Suppose you want to add an acl "Principals User:Bob and User:Alice are allowed to perform Operation Read and Write on Topic Test-Topic from IP 198.51.100.0 and IP 198.51.100.1". You can do that by executing the CLI with following options:
            <pre class="brush: bash;">bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --add --allow-principal User:Bob --allow-principal User:Alice --allow-host 198.51.100.0 --allow-host 198.51.100.1 --operation Read --operation Write --topic Test-topic</pre>
            By default, all principals that don't have an explicit acl that allows access for an operation to a resource are denied. In rare cases where an allow acl is defined that allows access to all but some principal we will have to use the --deny-principal and --deny-host option. For example, if we want to allow all users to Read from Test-topic but only deny User:BadBob from IP 198.51.100.3 we can do so using following commands:
            <pre class="brush: bash;">bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --add --allow-principal User:* --allow-host * --deny-principal User:BadBob --deny-host 198.51.100.3 --operation Read --topic Test-topic</pre>
            Note that ``--allow-host`` and ``deny-host`` only support IP addresses (hostnames are not supported).
            Above examples add acls to a topic by specifying --topic [topic-name] as the resource option. Similarly user can add acls to cluster by specifying --cluster and to a consumer group by specifying --group [group-name].</li>
            You can add acls on any resource of a certain type, e.g. suppose you wanted to add an acl "Principal User:Peter is allowed to produce to any Topic from IP 198.51.200.0"
            You can do that by using the wildcard resource '*', e.g. by executing the CLI with following options:
            <pre class="brush: bash;">bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --add --allow-principal User:Peter --allow-host 198.51.200.1 --producer --topic *</pre>
            You can add acls on resources matching a certain prefix, e.g. suppose you want to add an acl "Principal User:Jane is allowed to produce to any Topic whose name is prefixed with 'Test-' from any host".
            You can do that by executing the CLI with following options:
            <pre class="brush: bash;">bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --add --allow-principal User:Jane --producer --topic Test- --resource-name-type Prefixed</pre>
            Note, --resource-name-type defaults to 'literal', which only affects resources with the exact same name. The exception to this is the wildcard resource name '*', which should also be added using 'literal'.

        <li><b>Removing Acls</b><br>
                Removing acls is pretty much the same. The only difference is instead of --add option users will have to specify --remove option. To remove the acls added by the first example above we can execute the CLI with following options:
            <pre class="brush: bash;"> bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --remove --allow-principal User:Bob --allow-principal User:Alice --allow-host 198.51.100.0 --allow-host 198.51.100.1 --operation Read --operation Write --topic Test-topic </pre></li>
            If you wan to remove the prefixed acl added above we can execute the CLI with following options:
            <pre class="brush: bash;"> bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --remove --allow-principal User:Jane --producer --topic Test- --resource-name-type Prefixed</pre></li>

        <li><b>List Acls</b><br>
                We can list acls for any resource by specifying the --list option with the resource. To list all acls for Test-topic we can execute the CLI with following options:
                <pre class="brush: bash;">bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --list --topic Test-topic</pre></li>
                However, this will only return the acls that have been added to this exact resource. Other acls can exist that affect access to the topic,
                e.g. any acls on the topic wildcard '*', or any acls on resources matching a certain prefix. To list all acls affecting a topic we can use the '--resource-name-type any' option, e.g.
                <pre class="brush: bash;">bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --list --topic Test-topic --resource-name-type any</pre></li>

        <li><b>Adding or removing a principal as producer or consumer</b><br>
                The most common use case for acl management are adding/removing a principal as producer or consumer so we added convenience options to handle these cases. In order to add User:Bob as a producer of  Test-topic we can execute the following command:
            <pre class="brush: bash;"> bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --add --allow-principal User:Bob --producer --topic Test-topic</pre>
                Similarly to add Alice as a consumer of Test-topic with consumer group Group-1 we just have to pass --consumer option:
            <pre class="brush: bash;"> bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --add --allow-principal User:Bob --consumer --topic Test-topic --group Group-1 </pre>
                Note that for consumer option we must also specify the consumer group.
                In order to remove a principal from producer or consumer role we just need to pass --remove option. </li>
        </ul>

    <h3><a id="security_rolling_upgrade" href="#security_rolling_upgrade">7.5 Incorporating Security Features in a Running Cluster</a></h3>
        You can secure a running cluster via one or more of the supported protocols discussed previously. This is done in phases:
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Incrementally bounce the cluster nodes to open additional secured port(s).</li>
            <li>Restart clients using the secured rather than PLAINTEXT port (assuming you are securing the client-broker connection).</li>
            <li>Incrementally bounce the cluster again to enable broker-to-broker security (if this is required)</li>
            <li>A final incremental bounce to close the PLAINTEXT port.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        The specific steps for configuring SSL and SASL are described in sections <a href="#security_ssl">7.2</a> and <a href="#security_sasl">7.3</a>.
        Follow these steps to enable security for your desired protocol(s).
        <p></p>
        The security implementation lets you configure different protocols for both broker-client and broker-broker communication.
        These must be enabled in separate bounces. A PLAINTEXT port must be left open throughout so brokers and/or clients can continue to communicate.
        <p></p>

        When performing an incremental bounce stop the brokers cleanly via a SIGTERM. It's also good practice to wait for restarted replicas to return to the ISR list before moving onto the next node.
        <p></p>
        As an example, say we wish to encrypt both broker-client and broker-broker communication with SSL. In the first incremental bounce, a SSL port is opened on each node:
            <pre>
            listeners=PLAINTEXT://broker1:9091,SSL://broker1:9092
            </pre>

        We then restart the clients, changing their config to point at the newly opened, secured port:

            <pre>
            bootstrap.servers = [broker1:9092,...]
            security.protocol = SSL
            ...etc
            </pre>

        In the second incremental server bounce we instruct Kafka to use SSL as the broker-broker protocol (which will use the same SSL port):

            <pre>
            listeners=PLAINTEXT://broker1:9091,SSL://broker1:9092
            security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL
            </pre>

        In the final bounce we secure the cluster by closing the PLAINTEXT port:

            <pre>
            listeners=SSL://broker1:9092
            security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL
            </pre>

        Alternatively we might choose to open multiple ports so that different protocols can be used for broker-broker and broker-client communication. Say we wished to use SSL encryption throughout (i.e. for broker-broker and broker-client communication) but we'd like to add SASL authentication to the broker-client connection also. We would achieve this by opening two additional ports during the first bounce:

            <pre>
            listeners=PLAINTEXT://broker1:9091,SSL://broker1:9092,SASL_SSL://broker1:9093
            </pre>

        We would then restart the clients, changing their config to point at the newly opened, SASL & SSL secured port:

            <pre>
            bootstrap.servers = [broker1:9093,...]
            security.protocol = SASL_SSL
            ...etc
            </pre>

        The second server bounce would switch the cluster to use encrypted broker-broker communication via the SSL port we previously opened on port 9092:

            <pre>
            listeners=PLAINTEXT://broker1:9091,SSL://broker1:9092,SASL_SSL://broker1:9093
            security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL
            </pre>

        The final bounce secures the cluster by closing the PLAINTEXT port.

            <pre>
        listeners=SSL://broker1:9092,SASL_SSL://broker1:9093
        security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL
            </pre>

        ZooKeeper can be secured independently of the Kafka cluster. The steps for doing this are covered in section <a href="#zk_authz_migration">7.6.2</a>.


    <h3><a id="zk_authz" href="#zk_authz">7.6 ZooKeeper Authentication</a></h3>
    <h4><a id="zk_authz_new" href="#zk_authz_new">7.6.1 New clusters</a></h4>
    To enable ZooKeeper authentication on brokers, there are two necessary steps:
    <ol>
        <li> Create a JAAS login file and set the appropriate system property to point to it as described above</li>
        <li> Set the configuration property <tt>zookeeper.set.acl</tt> in each broker to true</li>
    </ol>

    The metadata stored in ZooKeeper for the Kafka cluster is world-readable, but can only be modified by the brokers. The rationale behind this decision is that the data stored in ZooKeeper is not sensitive, but inappropriate manipulation of that data can cause cluster disruption. We also recommend limiting the access to ZooKeeper via network segmentation (only brokers and some admin tools need access to ZooKeeper if the new Java consumer and producer clients are used).

    <h4><a id="zk_authz_migration" href="#zk_authz_migration">7.6.2 Migrating clusters</a></h4>
    If you are running a version of Kafka that does not support security or simply with security disabled, and you want to make the cluster secure, then you need to execute the following steps to enable ZooKeeper authentication with minimal disruption to your operations:
    <ol>
        <li>Perform a rolling restart setting the JAAS login file, which enables brokers to authenticate. At the end of the rolling restart, brokers are able to manipulate znodes with strict ACLs, but they will not create znodes with those ACLs</li>
        <li>Perform a second rolling restart of brokers, this time setting the configuration parameter <tt>zookeeper.set.acl</tt> to true, which enables the use of secure ACLs when creating znodes</li>
        <li>Execute the ZkSecurityMigrator tool. To execute the tool, there is this script: <tt>./bin/zookeeper-security-migration.sh</tt> with <tt>zookeeper.acl</tt> set to secure. This tool traverses the corresponding sub-trees changing the ACLs of the znodes</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is also possible to turn off authentication in a secure cluster. To do it, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Perform a rolling restart of brokers setting the JAAS login file, which enables brokers to authenticate, but setting <tt>zookeeper.set.acl</tt> to false. At the end of the rolling restart, brokers stop creating znodes with secure ACLs, but are still able to authenticate and manipulate all znodes</li>
        <li>Execute the ZkSecurityMigrator tool. To execute the tool, run this script <tt>./bin/zookeeper-security-migration.sh</tt> with <tt>zookeeper.acl</tt> set to unsecure. This tool traverses the corresponding sub-trees changing the ACLs of the znodes</li>
        <li>Perform a second rolling restart of brokers, this time omitting the system property that sets the JAAS login file</li>
    </ol>
    Here is an example of how to run the migration tool:
    <pre class="brush: bash;">
    ./bin/zookeeper-security-migration.sh --zookeeper.acl=secure --zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181
    </pre>
    <p>Run this to see the full list of parameters:</p>
    <pre class="brush: bash;">
    ./bin/zookeeper-security-migration.sh --help
    </pre>
    <h4><a id="zk_authz_ensemble" href="#zk_authz_ensemble">7.6.3 Migrating the ZooKeeper ensemble</a></h4>
    It is also necessary to enable authentication on the ZooKeeper ensemble. To do it, we need to perform a rolling restart of the server and set a few properties. Please refer to the ZooKeeper documentation for more detail:
