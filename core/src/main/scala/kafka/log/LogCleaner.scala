/**
 * The cleaner is responsible for removing obsolete records from logs which have the "compact" retention strategy.
 * A message with key K and offset O is obsolete if there exists a message with key K and offset O' such that O < O'.
 * 
 * Each log can be thought of being split into two sections of segments: a "clean" section which has previously been cleaned followed by a
 * "dirty" section that has not yet been cleaned. The dirty section is further divided into the "cleanable" section followed by an "uncleanable" section.
 * The uncleanable section is excluded from cleaning. The active log segment is always uncleanable. If there is a
 * compaction lag time set, segments whose largest message timestamp is within the compaction lag time of the cleaning operation are also uncleanable.
 *
 * The cleaning is carried out by a pool of background threads. Each thread chooses the dirtiest log that has the "compact" retention policy
 * and cleans that. The dirtiness of the log is guessed by taking the ratio of bytes in the dirty section of the log to the total bytes in the log. 
 * 
 * To clean a log the cleaner first builds a mapping of key=>last_offset for the dirty section of the log. See kafka.log.OffsetMap for details of
 * the implementation of the mapping. 
 * 
 * Once the key=>offset map is built, the log is cleaned by recopying each log segment but omitting any key that appears in the offset map with a 
 * higher offset than what is found in the segment (i.e. messages with a key that appears in the dirty section of the log).
 * 
 * To avoid segments shrinking to very small sizes with repeated cleanings we implement a rule by which if we will merge successive segments when
 * doing a cleaning if their log and index size are less than the maximum log and index size prior to the clean beginning.
 * 
 * Cleaned segments are swapped into the log as they become available.
 * 
 * One nuance that the cleaner must handle is log truncation. If a log is truncated while it is being cleaned the cleaning of that log is aborted.
 * 
 * Messages with null payload are treated as deletes for the purpose of log compaction. This means that they receive special treatment by the cleaner. 
 * The cleaner will only retain delete records for a period of time to avoid accumulating space indefinitely. This period of time is configurable on a per-topic
 * basis and is measured from the time the segment enters the clean portion of the log (at which point any prior message with that key has been removed).
 * Delete markers in the clean section of the log that are older than this time will not be retained when log segments are being recopied as part of cleaning.
 * 
 * @param config Configuration parameters for the cleaner
 * @param logDirs The directories where offset checkpoints reside
 * @param logs The pool of logs
 * @param time A way to control the passage of time
