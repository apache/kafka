/**
 * An index that maps from the timestamp to the logical offsets of the messages in a segment. This index might be
 * sparse, i.e. it may not hold an entry for all the messages in the segment.
 *
 * The index is stored in a file that is preallocated to hold a fixed maximum amount of 12-byte time index entries.
 * The file format is a series of time index entries. The physical format is a 8 bytes timestamp and a 4 bytes "relative"
 * offset used in the [[OffsetIndex]]. A time index entry (TIMESTAMP, OFFSET) means that the biggest timestamp seen
 * before OFFSET is TIMESTAMP. i.e. Any message whose timestamp is greater than TIMESTAMP must come after OFFSET.
 *
 * All external APIs translate from relative offsets to full offsets, so users of this class do not interact with the internal
 * storage format.
 *
 * The timestamps in the same time index file are guaranteed to be monotonically increasing.
 *
 * The index support timestamp lookup for a memory map of this file. The lookup is done using a binary search to find
 * the offset of the message whose indexed timestamp is closest but smaller or equals to the target timestamp.
 *
 * Time index files can be opened in two ways: either as an empty, mutable index that allows appends or
 * an immutable read-only index file that has previously been populated. The makeReadOnly method will turn a mutable file into an
 * immutable one and truncate off any extra bytes. This is done when the index file is rolled over.
 *
 * No attempt is made to checksum the contents of this file, in the event of a crash it is rebuilt.
