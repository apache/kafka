  /**
   * This method enables the feature versioning system (KIP-584).
   *
   * Development in Kafka (from a high level) is organized into features. Each feature is tracked by
   * a name and a range of version numbers or a version number. A feature can be of two types:
   *
   * 1. Supported feature:
   * A supported feature is represented by a name (string) and a range of versions (defined by a
   * SupportedVersionRange). It refers to a feature that a particular broker advertises support for.
   * Each broker advertises the version ranges of its own supported features in its own
   * BrokerIdZNode. The contents of the advertisement are specific to the particular broker and
   * do not represent any guarantee of a cluster-wide availability of the feature for any particular
   * range of versions.
   *
   * 2. Finalized feature:
   * A finalized feature is represented by a name (string) and a specified version level (defined
   * by a Short). Whenever the feature versioning system (KIP-584) is
   * enabled, the finalized features are stored in the cluster-wide common FeatureZNode.
   * In comparison to a supported feature, the key difference is that a finalized feature exists
   * in ZK only when it is guaranteed to be supported by any random broker in the cluster for a
   * specified range of version levels. Also, the controller is the only entity modifying the
   * information about finalized features.
   *
   * This method sets up the FeatureZNode with enabled status, which means that the finalized
   * features stored in the FeatureZNode are active. The enabled status should be written by the
   * controller to the FeatureZNode only when the broker IBP config is greater than or equal to
   * IBP_2_7_IV0.
   *
   * There are multiple cases handled here:
   *
   * 1. New cluster bootstrap:
   *    A new Kafka cluster (i.e. it is deployed first time) is almost always started with IBP config
   *    setting greater than or equal to IBP_2_7_IV0. We would like to start the cluster with all
   *    the possible supported features finalized immediately. Assuming this is the case, the
   *    controller will start up and notice that the FeatureZNode is absent in the new cluster,
   *    it will then create a FeatureZNode (with enabled status) containing the entire list of
   *    supported features as its finalized features.
   *
   * 2. Broker binary upgraded, but IBP config set to lower than IBP_2_7_IV0:
   *    Imagine there was an existing Kafka cluster with IBP config less than IBP_2_7_IV0, and the
   *    broker binary has now been upgraded to a newer version that supports the feature versioning
   *    system (KIP-584). But the IBP config is still set to lower than IBP_2_7_IV0, and may be
   *    set to a higher value later. In this case, we want to start with no finalized features and
   *    allow the user to finalize them whenever they are ready i.e. in the future whenever the
   *    user sets IBP config to be greater than or equal to IBP_2_7_IV0, then the user could start
   *    finalizing the features. This process ensures we do not enable all the possible features
   *    immediately after an upgrade, which could be harmful to Kafka.
   *    This is how we handle such a case:
   *      - Before the IBP config upgrade (i.e. IBP config set to less than IBP_2_7_IV0), the
   *        controller will start up and check if the FeatureZNode is absent.
   *        - If the node is absent, it will react by creating a FeatureZNode with disabled status
   *          and empty finalized features.
   *        - Otherwise, if a node already exists in enabled status then the controller will just
   *          flip the status to disabled and clear the finalized features.
   *      - After the IBP config upgrade (i.e. IBP config set to greater than or equal to
   *        IBP_2_7_IV0), when the controller starts up it will check if the FeatureZNode exists
   *        and whether it is disabled.
   *         - If the node is in disabled status, the controller won’t upgrade all features immediately.
   *           Instead it will just switch the FeatureZNode status to enabled status. This lets the
   *           user finalize the features later.
   *         - Otherwise, if a node already exists in enabled status then the controller will leave
   *           the node umodified.
   *
   * 3. Broker binary upgraded, with existing cluster IBP config >= IBP_2_7_IV0:
   *    Imagine there was an existing Kafka cluster with IBP config >= IBP_2_7_IV0, and the broker
   *    binary has just been upgraded to a newer version (that supports IBP config IBP_2_7_IV0 and
   *    higher). The controller will start up and find that a FeatureZNode is already present with
   *    enabled status and existing finalized features. In such a case, the controller leaves the node
   *    unmodified.
   *
   * 4. Broker downgrade:
   *    Imagine that a Kafka cluster exists already and the IBP config is greater than or equal to
   *    IBP_2_7_IV0. Then, the user decided to downgrade the cluster by setting IBP config to a
   *    value less than IBP_2_7_IV0. This means the user is also disabling the feature versioning
   *    system (KIP-584). In this case, when the controller starts up with the lower IBP config, it
   *    will switch the FeatureZNode status to disabled with empty features.

   * 3. When an ongoing reassignment finishes - this is detected by a change in the partition's ISR znode
   * 4. Whenever a new broker comes up which is part of an ongoing reassignment
   * 5. On controller startup/failover
   *
   * Reassigning replicas for a partition goes through a few steps listed in the code.
   * RS = current assigned replica set
   * ORS = Original replica set for partition
   * TRS = Reassigned (target) replica set
   * AR = The replicas we are adding as part of this reassignment
   * RR = The replicas we are removing as part of this reassignment
   *
   * A reassignment may have up to three phases, each with its own steps:

   * Phase U (Assignment update): Regardless of the trigger, the first step is in the reassignment process
   * is to update the existing assignment state. We always update the state in Zookeeper before
   * we update memory so that it can be resumed upon controller fail-over.
   *
   *   U1. Update ZK with RS = ORS + TRS, AR = TRS - ORS, RR = ORS - TRS.
   *   U2. Update memory with RS = ORS + TRS, AR = TRS - ORS and RR = ORS - TRS
   *   U3. If we are cancelling or replacing an existing reassignment, send StopReplica to all members
   *       of AR in the original reassignment if they are not in TRS from the new assignment
   *
   * To complete the reassignment, we need to bring the new replicas into sync, so depending on the state
   * of the ISR, we will execute one of the following steps.
   *
   * Phase A (when TRS != ISR): The reassignment is not yet complete
   *
   *   A1. Bump the leader epoch for the partition and send LeaderAndIsr updates to RS.
   *   A2. Start new replicas AR by moving replicas in AR to NewReplica state.
   *
   * Phase B (when TRS = ISR): The reassignment is complete
   *
   *   B1. Move all replicas in AR to OnlineReplica state.
   *   B2. Set RS = TRS, AR = [], RR = [] in memory.
   *   B3. Send a LeaderAndIsr request with RS = TRS. This will prevent the leader from adding any replica in TRS - ORS back in the isr.
   *       If the current leader is not in TRS or isn't alive, we move the leader to a new replica in TRS.
   *       We may send the LeaderAndIsr to more than the TRS replicas due to the
   *       way the partition state machine works (it reads replicas from ZK)
   *   B4. Move all replicas in RR to OfflineReplica state. As part of OfflineReplica state change, we shrink the
   *       isr to remove RR in ZooKeeper and send a LeaderAndIsr ONLY to the Leader to notify it of the shrunk isr.
   *       After that, we send a StopReplica (delete = false) to the replicas in RR.
   *   B5. Move all replicas in RR to NonExistentReplica state. This will send a StopReplica (delete = true) to
   *       the replicas in RR to physically delete the replicas on disk.
   *   B6. Update ZK with RS=TRS, AR=[], RR=[].
   *   B7. Remove the ISR reassign listener and maybe update the /admin/reassign_partitions path in ZK to remove this partition from it if present.
   *   B8. After electing leader, the replicas and isr information changes. So resend the update metadata request to every broker.
   *
   * In general, there are two goals we want to aim for:
   * 1. Every replica present in the replica set of a LeaderAndIsrRequest gets the request sent to it
   * 2. Replicas that are removed from a partition's assignment get StopReplica sent to them
   *
   * For example, if ORS = {1,2,3} and TRS = {4,5,6}, the values in the topic and leader/isr paths in ZK
   * may go through the following transitions.
   * RS                AR          RR          leader     isr
   * {1,2,3}           {}          {}          1          {1,2,3}           (initial state)
   * {4,5,6,1,2,3}     {4,5,6}     {1,2,3}     1          {1,2,3}           (step A2)
   * {4,5,6,1,2,3}     {4,5,6}     {1,2,3}     1          {1,2,3,4,5,6}     (phase B)
   * {4,5,6,1,2,3}     {4,5,6}     {1,2,3}     4          {1,2,3,4,5,6}     (step B3)
   * {4,5,6,1,2,3}     {4,5,6}     {1,2,3}     4          {4,5,6}           (step B4)
   * {4,5,6}           {}          {}          4          {4,5,6}           (step B6)
   *
   * Note that we have to update RS in ZK with TRS last since it's the only place where we store ORS persistently.
   * This way, if the controller crashes before that step, we can still recover.
