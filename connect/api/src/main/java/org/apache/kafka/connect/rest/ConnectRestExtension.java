/**
 * A plugin interface to allow registration of new JAX-RS resources like Filters, REST endpoints, providers, etc. The implementations will
 * be discovered using the standard Java {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} mechanism by  Connect's plugin class loading mechanism.
 *
 * <p>Kafka Connect discovers implementations of this interface using the Java {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} mechanism.
 * To support this, implementations of this interface should also contain a service provider configuration file in
 * {@code META-INF/services/org.apache.kafka.connect.rest.ConnectRestExtension}.
 * <p>The extension class(es) must be packaged as a plugin, including the JARs of all dependencies except those
 * already provided by the Connect framework.
 *
 * <p>To install into a Connect installation, add a directory named for the plugin and containing the plugin's JARs into a directory that is
 * on Connect's {@code plugin.path}, and (re)start the Connect worker.
 *
 * <p>When the Connect worker process starts up, it will read its configuration and instantiate all of the REST extension implementation
 * classes that are specified in the `rest.extension.classes` configuration property. Connect will then pass its configuration to each
 * extension via the {@link Configurable#configure(Map)} method, and will then call {@link #register} with a provided context.
 *
 * <p>When the Connect worker shuts down, it will call the extension's {@link #close} method to allow the implementation to release all of
 * its resources.
