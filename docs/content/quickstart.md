# Quickstart

## Step 1: Get Kafka {#quickstart_download .anchor-link}

[Download](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/kafka/{{< param akFullDotVersion >}}/kafka_{{< param scalaVersion >}}-{{< param akFullDotVersion >}}.tgz)
the latest Kafka release and extract it:

```shell {linenos=false}
$ tar -xzf kafka_{{< param scalaVersion >}}-{{< param akFullDotVersion >}}.tgz
$ cd kafka_{{< param scalaVersion >}}-{{< param akFullDotVersion >}}
```

## Step 2: Start the Kafka environment {#quickstart_startserver .anchor-link}

NOTE: Your local environment must have Java 8+ installed.

Apache Kafka can be started using ZooKeeper or KRaft. To get started
with either configuration follow one the sections below but not both.

### Kafka with ZooKeeper

Run the following commands in order to start all services in the correct
order:

```shell {linenos=false}
# Start the ZooKeeper service
$ bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
```

Open another terminal session and run:

```shell {linenos=false}
# Start the Kafka broker service
$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

Once all services have successfully launched, you will have a basic
Kafka environment running and ready to use.

### Kafka with KRaft

Generate a Cluster UUID

```shell {linenos=false}
$ KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID="$(bin/kafka-storage.sh random-uuid)"
```

Format Log Directories

```shell {linenos=false}
$ bin/kafka-storage.sh format -t $KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID -c config/kraft/server.properties
```

Start the Kafka Server

```shell {linenos=false}
$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/kraft/server.properties
```

Once the Kafka server has successfully launched, you will have a basic
Kafka environment running and ready to use.

## Step 3: Create a topic to store your events {#quickstart_createtopic .anchor-link}

Kafka is a distributed *event streaming platform* that lets you read,
write, store, and process [*events*](../implementation/#messages) 
(also called *records* or *messages* in the documentation) across many machines.

Example events are payment transactions, geolocation updates from mobile
phones, shipping orders, sensor measurements from IoT devices or medical
equipment, and much more. These events are organized and stored in
[*topics*](../intro#intro_concepts_and_terms). Very simplified, a
topic is similar to a folder in a filesystem, and the events are the
files in that folder.

So before you can write your first events, you must create a topic. Open
another terminal session and run:

```shell {linenos=false}
$ bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

All of Kafka\'s command line tools have additional options: run the
`kafka-topics.sh` command without any arguments to display usage
information. For example, it can also show you 
[details such as the partition count](../intro#intro_concepts_and_terms) of the new topic:

```shell {linenos=false}
$ bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
Topic: quickstart-events        TopicId: NPmZHyhbR9y00wMglMH2sg PartitionCount: 1       ReplicationFactor: 1    Configs:
    Topic: quickstart-events Partition: 0    Leader: 0   Replicas: 0 Isr: 0
```

## Step 4: Write some events into the topic {#quickstart_send .anchor-link}

A Kafka client communicates with the Kafka brokers via the network for
writing (or reading) events. Once received, the brokers will store the
events in a durable and fault-tolerant manner for as long as you
need—even forever.

Run the console producer client to write a few events into your topic.
By default, each line you enter will result in a separate event being
written to the topic.

```shell {linenos=false}
$ bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
This is my first event
This is my second event
```

You can stop the producer client with `Ctrl-C` at any time.

## Step 5: Read the events {#quickstart_consume .anchor-link}

Open another terminal session and run the console consumer client to
read the events you just created:

```shell {linenos=false}
$ bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic quickstart-events --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
This is my first event
This is my second event
```

You can stop the consumer client with `Ctrl-C` at any time.

Feel free to experiment: for example, switch back to your producer
terminal (previous step) to write additional events, and see how the
events immediately show up in your consumer terminal.

Because events are durably stored in Kafka, they can be read as many
times and by as many consumers as you want. You can easily verify this
by opening yet another terminal session and re-running the previous
command again.

## Step 6: Import/export your data as streams of events with Kafka Connect {#quickstart_kafkaconnect .anchor-link}

You probably have lots of data in existing systems like relational
databases or traditional messaging systems, along with many applications
that already use these systems. [Kafka Connect](../connect)
allows you to continuously ingest data from external systems into Kafka,
and vice versa. It is an extensible tool that runs *connectors*, which
implement the custom logic for interacting with an external system. It
is thus very easy to integrate existing systems with Kafka. To make this
process even easier, there are hundreds of such connectors readily
available.

In this quickstart we\'ll see how to run Kafka Connect with simple
connectors that import data from a file to a Kafka topic and export data
from a Kafka topic to a file.

First, make sure to add
`connect-file-{{< param akFullDotVersion >}}.jar` to the
`plugin.path` property in the Connect worker\'s configuration. For the
purpose of this quickstart we\'ll use a relative path and consider the
connectors\' package as an uber jar, which works when the quickstart
commands are run from the installation directory. However, it\'s worth
noting that for production deployments using absolute paths is always
preferable. See
//TODO fix config link
[plugin.path](../connectconfigs_plugin.path) for a detailed
description of how to set this config.

Edit the `config/connect-standalone.properties` file,
add or change the `plugin.path` configuration property match the
following, and save the file:

```shell {linenos=false}
> echo "plugin.path=libs/connect-file-{{< param akFullDotVersion >}}.jar"
```

Then, start by creating some seed data to test with:

```shell {linenos=false}
> echo -e "foo\nbar" > test.txt
```

Or on Windows:

```shell {linenos=false}
> echo foo> test.txt
> echo bar>> test.txt
```

Next, we\'ll start two connectors running in *standalone* mode, which
means they run in a single, local, dedicated process. We provide three
configuration files as parameters. The first is always the configuration
for the Kafka Connect process, containing common configuration such as
the Kafka brokers to connect to and the serialization format for data.
The remaining configuration files each specify a connector to create.
These files include a unique connector name, the connector class to
instantiate, and any other configuration required by the connector.

```shell {linenos=false}
bin/connect-standalone.sh \
  config/connect-standalone.properties \
  config/connect-file-source.properties \
  config/connect-file-sink.properties
```

These sample configuration files, included with Kafka, use the default
local cluster configuration you started earlier and create two
connectors: the first is a source connector that reads lines from an
input file and produces each to a Kafka topic and the second is a sink
connector that reads messages from a Kafka topic and produces each as a
line in an output file.

During startup you\'ll see a number of log messages, including some
indicating that the connectors are being instantiated. Once the Kafka
Connect process has started, the source connector should start reading
lines from `test.txt` and producing them to the topic `connect-test`,
and the sink connector should start reading messages from the topic
`connect-test` and write them to the file `test.sink.txt`. We can verify
the data has been delivered through the entire pipeline by examining the
contents of the output file:

```shell {linenos=false}
> more test.sink.txt
foo
bar
```

Note that the data is being stored in the Kafka topic `connect-test`, so
we can also run a console consumer to see the data in the topic (or use
custom consumer code to process it):

```shell {linenos=false}
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --topic connect-test \
  --from-beginning
{"schema":{"type":"string","optional":false},"payload":"foo"}
{"schema":{"type":"string","optional":false},"payload":"bar"}
...
```

The connectors continue to process data, so we can add data to the file
and see it move through the pipeline:

```shell {linenos=false}
> echo Another line>> test.txt
```

You should see the line appear in the console consumer output and in the
sink file.

## Step 7: Process your events with Kafka Streams {#quickstart_kafkastreams .anchor-link}

Once your data is stored in Kafka as events, you can process the data
with the [Kafka Streams](../streams) client library for
Java/Scala. It allows you to implement mission-critical real-time
applications and microservices, where the input and/or output data is
stored in Kafka topics. Kafka Streams combines the simplicity of writing
and deploying standard Java and Scala applications on the client side
with the benefits of Kafka\'s server-side cluster technology to make
these applications highly scalable, elastic, fault-tolerant, and
distributed. The library supports exactly-once processing, stateful
operations and aggregations, windowing, joins, processing based on
event-time, and much more.

To give you a first taste, here\'s how one would implement the popular
`WordCount` algorithm:

```java
KStream<String, String> textLines = builder.stream("quickstart-events");

KTable<String, Long> wordCounts = textLines
            .flatMapValues(line -> Arrays.asList(line.toLowerCase().split(" ")))
            .groupBy((keyIgnored, word) -> word)
            .count();

wordCounts.toStream().to("output-topic", Produced.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.Long()));
```

The [Kafka Streams demo](../streams/quickstart) and the [app development tutorial](../streams/tutorial)
demonstrate how to code and run such a streaming application from start
to finish.

## Step 8: Terminate the Kafka environment {#quickstart_kafkaterminate .anchor-link}

Now that you reached the end of the quickstart, feel free to tear down
the Kafka environment---or continue playing around.

1.  Stop the producer and consumer clients with `Ctrl-C`, if you
    haven\'t done so already.
2.  Stop the Kafka broker with `Ctrl-C`.
3.  Lastly, if the Kafka with ZooKeeper section was followed, stop the
    ZooKeeper server with `Ctrl-C`.

If you also want to delete any data of your local Kafka environment
including any events you have created along the way, run the command:

```shell {linenos=false}
$ rm -rf /tmp/kafka-logs /tmp/zookeeper /tmp/kraft-combined-logs
```
