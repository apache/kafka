 * records (both key and value type can be altered arbitrarily).
 * This is a stateful record-by-record operation, i.e, {@link #transform(Object, Object)} is invoked individually for
 * each record of a stream and can access and modify a state that is available beyond a single call of
 * {@link #transform(Object, Object)} (cf. {@link KeyValueMapper} for stateless record transformation).
 * Additionally, this {@code Transformer} can {@link ProcessorContext#schedule(long, PunctuationType, Punctuator) schedule}
 * a method to be {@link Punctuator#punctuate(long) called periodically} with the provided context.
 * <p>
 * Use {@link TransformerSupplier} to provide new instances of {@code Transformer} to Kafka Stream's runtime.
 * <p>
 * If only a record's value should be modified {@link ValueTransformer} can be used.
