/**
 * A client that consumes records from a Kafka cluster.
 * <p>
 * This client transparently handles the failure of Kafka brokers, and transparently adapts as topic partitions
 * it fetches migrate within the cluster. This client also interacts with the broker to allow groups of
 * consumers to load balance consumption using <a href="#consumergroups">consumer groups</a>.
 * <p>
 * The consumer maintains TCP connections to the necessary brokers to fetch data.
 * Failure to close the consumer after use will leak these connections.
 * The consumer is not thread-safe. See <a href="#multithreaded">Multi-threaded Processing</a> for more details.
 *
 * <h3>Cross-Version Compatibility</h3>
 * This client can communicate with brokers that are version 0.10.0 or newer. Older or newer brokers may not support
 * certain features. For example, 0.10.0 brokers do not support offsetsForTimes, because this feature was added
 * in version 0.10.1. You will receive an {@link org.apache.kafka.common.errors.UnsupportedVersionException}
 * when invoking an API that is not available on the running broker version.
 * <p>
 *
 * <h3>Offsets and Consumer Position</h3>
 * Kafka maintains a numerical offset for each record in a partition. This offset acts as a unique identifier of
 * a record within that partition, and also denotes the position of the consumer in the partition. For example, a consumer
 * which is at position 5 has consumed records with offsets 0 through 4 and will next receive the record with offset 5. There
 * are actually two notions of position relevant to the user of the consumer:
 * <p>
 * The {@link #position(TopicPartition) position} of the consumer gives the offset of the next record that will be given
 * out. It will be one larger than the highest offset the consumer has seen in that partition. It automatically advances
 * every time the consumer receives messages in a call to {@link #poll(Duration)}.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #commitSync() committed position} is the last offset that has been stored securely. Should the
 * process fail and restart, this is the offset that the consumer will recover to. The consumer can either automatically commit
 * offsets periodically; or it can choose to control this committed position manually by calling one of the commit APIs
 * (e.g. {@link #commitSync() commitSync} and {@link #commitAsync(OffsetCommitCallback) commitAsync}).
 * <p>
 * This distinction gives the consumer control over when a record is considered consumed. It is discussed in further
 * detail below.
 *
 * <h3><a name="consumergroups">Consumer Groups and Topic Subscriptions</a></h3>
 *
 * Kafka uses the concept of <i>consumer groups</i> to allow a pool of processes to divide the work of consuming and
 * processing records. These processes can either be running on the same machine or they can be
 * distributed over many machines to provide scalability and fault tolerance for processing. All consumer instances
 * sharing the same {@code group.id} will be part of the same consumer group.
 * <p>
 * Each consumer in a group can dynamically set the list of topics it wants to subscribe to through one of the
 * {@link #subscribe(Collection, ConsumerRebalanceListener) subscribe} APIs. Kafka will deliver each message in the
 * subscribed topics to one process in each consumer group. This is achieved by balancing the partitions between all
 * members in the consumer group so that each partition is assigned to exactly one consumer in the group. So if there
 * is a topic with four partitions, and a consumer group with two processes, each process would consume from two partitions.
 * <p>
 * Membership in a consumer group is maintained dynamically: if a process fails, the partitions assigned to it will
 * be reassigned to other consumers in the same group. Similarly, if a new consumer joins the group, partitions will be moved
 * from existing consumers to the new one. This is known as <i>rebalancing</i> the group and is discussed in more
 * detail <a href="#failuredetection">below</a>. Group rebalancing is also used when new partitions are added
 * to one of the subscribed topics or when a new topic matching a {@link #subscribe(Pattern, ConsumerRebalanceListener) subscribed regex}
 * is created. The group will automatically detect the new partitions through periodic metadata refreshes and
 * assign them to members of the group.
 * <p>
 * Conceptually you can think of a consumer group as being a single logical subscriber that happens to be made up of
 * multiple processes. As a multi-subscriber system, Kafka naturally supports having any number of consumer groups for a
 * given topic without duplicating data (additional consumers are actually quite cheap).
 * <p>
 * This is a slight generalization of the functionality that is common in messaging systems. To get semantics similar to
 * a queue in a traditional messaging system all processes would be part of a single consumer group and hence record
 * delivery would be balanced over the group like with a queue. Unlike a traditional messaging system, though, you can
 * have multiple such groups. To get semantics similar to pub-sub in a traditional messaging system each process would
 * have its own consumer group, so each process would subscribe to all the records published to the topic.
 * <p>
 * In addition, when group reassignment happens automatically, consumers can be notified through a {@link ConsumerRebalanceListener},
 * which allows them to finish necessary application-level logic such as state cleanup, manual offset
 * commits, etc. See <a href="#rebalancecallback">Storing Offsets Outside Kafka</a> for more details.
 * <p>
 * It is also possible for the consumer to <a href="#manualassignment">manually assign</a> specific partitions
 * (similar to the older "simple" consumer) using {@link #assign(Collection)}. In this case, dynamic partition
 * assignment and consumer group coordination will be disabled.
 *
 * <h3><a name="failuredetection">Detecting Consumer Failures</a></h3>
 *
 * After subscribing to a set of topics, the consumer will automatically join the group when {@link #poll(Duration)} is
 * invoked. The poll API is designed to ensure consumer liveness. As long as you continue to call poll, the consumer
 * will stay in the group and continue to receive messages from the partitions it was assigned. Underneath the covers,
 * the consumer sends periodic heartbeats to the server. If the consumer crashes or is unable to send heartbeats for
 * a duration of {@code session.timeout.ms}, then the consumer will be considered dead and its partitions will
 * be reassigned.
 * <p>
 * It is also possible that the consumer could encounter a "livelock" situation where it is continuing
 * to send heartbeats, but no progress is being made. To prevent the consumer from holding onto its partitions
 * indefinitely in this case, we provide a liveness detection mechanism using the {@code max.poll.interval.ms}
 * setting. Basically if you don't call poll at least as frequently as the configured max interval,
 * then the client will proactively leave the group so that another consumer can take over its partitions. When this happens,
 * you may see an offset commit failure (as indicated by a {@link CommitFailedException} thrown from a call to {@link #commitSync()}).
 * This is a safety mechanism which guarantees that only active members of the group are able to commit offsets.
 * So to stay in the group, you must continue to call poll.
 * <p>
 * The consumer provides two configuration settings to control the behavior of the poll loop:
 * <ol>
 *     <li><code>max.poll.interval.ms</code>: By increasing the interval between expected polls, you can give
 *     the consumer more time to handle a batch of records returned from {@link #poll(Duration)}. The drawback
 *     is that increasing this value may delay a group rebalance since the consumer will only join the rebalance
 *     inside the call to poll. You can use this setting to bound the time to finish a rebalance, but
 *     you risk slower progress if the consumer cannot actually call {@link #poll(Duration) poll} often enough.</li>
 *     <li><code>max.poll.records</code>: Use this setting to limit the total records returned from a single
 *     call to poll. This can make it easier to predict the maximum that must be handled within each poll
 *     interval. By tuning this value, you may be able to reduce the poll interval, which will reduce the
 *     impact of group rebalancing.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * For use cases where message processing time varies unpredictably, neither of these options may be sufficient.
 * The recommended way to handle these cases is to move message processing to another thread, which allows
 * the consumer to continue calling {@link #poll(Duration) poll} while the processor is still working.
 * Some care must be taken to ensure that committed offsets do not get ahead of the actual position.
 * Typically, you must disable automatic commits and manually commit processed offsets for records only after the
 * thread has finished handling them (depending on the delivery semantics you need).
 * Note also that you will need to {@link #pause(Collection) pause} the partition so that no new records are received
 * from poll until after thread has finished handling those previously returned.
 *
 * <h3>Usage Examples</h3>
 * The consumer APIs offer flexibility to cover a variety of consumption use cases. Here are some examples to
 * demonstrate how to use them.
 *
 * <h4>Automatic Offset Committing</h4>
 * This example demonstrates a simple usage of Kafka's consumer api that relies on automatic offset committing.
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *     Properties props = new Properties();
 *     props.setProperty(&quot;bootstrap.servers&quot;, &quot;localhost:9092&quot;);
 *     props.setProperty(&quot;group.id&quot;, &quot;test&quot;);
 *     props.setProperty(&quot;enable.auto.commit&quot;, &quot;true&quot;);
 *     props.setProperty(&quot;auto.commit.interval.ms&quot;, &quot;1000&quot;);
 *     props.setProperty(&quot;key.deserializer&quot;, &quot;org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer&quot;);
 *     props.setProperty(&quot;value.deserializer&quot;, &quot;org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer&quot;);
 *     KafkaConsumer&lt;String, String&gt; consumer = new KafkaConsumer&lt;&gt;(props);
 *     consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;));
 *     while (true) {
 *         ConsumerRecords&lt;String, String&gt; records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
 *         for (ConsumerRecord&lt;String, String&gt; record : records)
 *             System.out.printf(&quot;offset = %d, key = %s, value = %s%n&quot;, record.offset(), record.key(), record.value());
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The connection to the cluster is bootstrapped by specifying a list of one or more brokers to contact using the
 * configuration {@code bootstrap.servers}. This list is just used to discover the rest of the brokers in the
 * cluster and need not be an exhaustive list of servers in the cluster (though you may want to specify more than one in
 * case there are servers down when the client is connecting).
 * <p>
 * Setting {@code enable.auto.commit} means that offsets are committed automatically with a frequency controlled by
 * the config {@code auto.commit.interval.ms}.
 * <p>
 * In this example the consumer is subscribing to the topics <i>foo</i> and <i>bar</i> as part of a group of consumers
 * called <i>test</i> as configured with {@code group.id}.
 * <p>
 * The deserializer settings specify how to turn bytes into objects. For example, by specifying string deserializers, we
 * are saying that our record's key and value will just be simple strings.
 *
 * <h4>Manual Offset Control</h4>
 *
 * Instead of relying on the consumer to periodically commit consumed offsets, users can also control when records
 * should be considered as consumed and hence commit their offsets. This is useful when the consumption of the messages
 * is coupled with some processing logic and hence a message should not be considered as consumed until it is completed processing.

 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *     Properties props = new Properties();
 *     props.setProperty(&quot;bootstrap.servers&quot;, &quot;localhost:9092&quot;);
 *     props.setProperty(&quot;group.id&quot;, &quot;test&quot;);
 *     props.setProperty(&quot;enable.auto.commit&quot;, &quot;false&quot;);
 *     props.setProperty(&quot;key.deserializer&quot;, &quot;org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer&quot;);
 *     props.setProperty(&quot;value.deserializer&quot;, &quot;org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer&quot;);
 *     KafkaConsumer&lt;String, String&gt; consumer = new KafkaConsumer&lt;&gt;(props);
 *     consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;));
 *     final int minBatchSize = 200;
 *     List&lt;ConsumerRecord&lt;String, String&gt;&gt; buffer = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
 *     while (true) {
 *         ConsumerRecords&lt;String, String&gt; records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
 *         for (ConsumerRecord&lt;String, String&gt; record : records) {
 *             buffer.add(record);
 *         }
 *         if (buffer.size() &gt;= minBatchSize) {
 *             insertIntoDb(buffer);
 *             consumer.commitSync();
 *             buffer.clear();
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * In this example we will consume a batch of records and batch them up in memory. When we have enough records
 * batched, we will insert them into a database. If we allowed offsets to auto commit as in the previous example, records
 * would be considered consumed after they were returned to the user in {@link #poll(Duration) poll}. It would then be
 * possible
 * for our process to fail after batching the records, but before they had been inserted into the database.
 * <p>
 * To avoid this, we will manually commit the offsets only after the corresponding records have been inserted into the
 * database. This gives us exact control of when a record is considered consumed. This raises the opposite possibility:
 * the process could fail in the interval after the insert into the database but before the commit (even though this
 * would likely just be a few milliseconds, it is a possibility). In this case the process that took over consumption
 * would consume from last committed offset and would repeat the insert of the last batch of data. Used in this way
 * Kafka provides what is often called "at-least-once" delivery guarantees, as each record will likely be delivered one
 * time but in failure cases could be duplicated.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note: Using automatic offset commits can also give you "at-least-once" delivery, but the requirement is that
 * you must consume all data returned from each call to {@link #poll(Duration)} before any subsequent calls, or before
 * {@link #close() closing} the consumer. If you fail to do either of these, it is possible for the committed offset
 * to get ahead of the consumed position, which results in missing records. The advantage of using manual offset
 * control is that you have direct control over when a record is considered "consumed."</b>
 * <p>
 * The above example uses {@link #commitSync() commitSync} to mark all received records as committed. In some cases
 * you may wish to have even finer control over which records have been committed by specifying an offset explicitly.
 * In the example below we commit offset after we finish handling the records in each partition.
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *     try {
 *         while(running) {
 *             ConsumerRecords&lt;String, String&gt; records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(Long.MAX_VALUE));
 *             for (TopicPartition partition : records.partitions()) {
 *                 List&lt;ConsumerRecord&lt;String, String&gt;&gt; partitionRecords = records.records(partition);
 *                 for (ConsumerRecord&lt;String, String&gt; record : partitionRecords) {
 *                     System.out.println(record.offset() + &quot;: &quot; + record.value());
 *                 }
 *                 long lastOffset = partitionRecords.get(partitionRecords.size() - 1).offset();
 *                 consumer.commitSync(Collections.singletonMap(partition, new OffsetAndMetadata(lastOffset + 1)));
 *             }
 *         }
 *     } finally {
 *       consumer.close();
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <b>Note: The committed offset should always be the offset of the next message that your application will read.</b>
 * Thus, when calling {@link #commitSync(Map) commitSync(offsets)} you should add one to the offset of the last message processed.
 *
 * <h4><a name="manualassignment">Manual Partition Assignment</a></h4>
 *
 * In the previous examples, we subscribed to the topics we were interested in and let Kafka dynamically assign a
 * fair share of the partitions for those topics based on the active consumers in the group. However, in
 * some cases you may need finer control over the specific partitions that are assigned. For example:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the process is maintaining some kind of local state associated with that partition (like a
 * local on-disk key-value store), then it should only get records for the partition it is maintaining on disk.
 * <li>If the process itself is highly available and will be restarted if it fails (perhaps using a
 * cluster management framework like YARN, Mesos, or AWS facilities, or as part of a stream processing framework). In
 * this case there is no need for Kafka to detect the failure and reassign the partition since the consuming process
 * will be restarted on another machine.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * To use this mode, instead of subscribing to the topic using {@link #subscribe(Collection) subscribe}, you just call
 * {@link #assign(Collection)} with the full list of partitions that you want to consume.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     String topic = &quot;foo&quot;;
 *     TopicPartition partition0 = new TopicPartition(topic, 0);
 *     TopicPartition partition1 = new TopicPartition(topic, 1);
 *     consumer.assign(Arrays.asList(partition0, partition1));
 * </pre>
 *
 * Once assigned, you can call {@link #poll(Duration) poll} in a loop, just as in the preceding examples to consume
 * records. The group that the consumer specifies is still used for committing offsets, but now the set of partitions
 * will only change with another call to {@link #assign(Collection) assign}. Manual partition assignment does
 * not use group coordination, so consumer failures will not cause assigned partitions to be rebalanced. Each consumer
 * acts independently even if it shares a groupId with another consumer. To avoid offset commit conflicts, you should
 * usually ensure that the groupId is unique for each consumer instance.
 * <p>
 * Note that it isn't possible to mix manual partition assignment (i.e. using {@link #assign(Collection) assign})
 * with dynamic partition assignment through topic subscription (i.e. using {@link #subscribe(Collection) subscribe}).
 *
 * <h4><a name="rebalancecallback">Storing Offsets Outside Kafka</h4>
 *
 * The consumer application need not use Kafka's built-in offset storage, it can store offsets in a store of its own
 * choosing. The primary use case for this is allowing the application to store both the offset and the results of the
 * consumption in the same system in a way that both the results and offsets are stored atomically. This is not always
 * possible, but when it is it will make the consumption fully atomic and give "exactly once" semantics that are
 * stronger than the default "at-least once" semantics you get with Kafka's offset commit functionality.
 * <p>
 * Here are a couple of examples of this type of usage:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the results of the consumption are being stored in a relational database, storing the offset in the database
 * as well can allow committing both the results and offset in a single transaction. Thus either the transaction will
 * succeed and the offset will be updated based on what was consumed or the result will not be stored and the offset
 * won't be updated.
 * <li>If the results are being stored in a local store it may be possible to store the offset there as well. For
 * example a search index could be built by subscribing to a particular partition and storing both the offset and the
 * indexed data together. If this is done in a way that is atomic, it is often possible to have it be the case that even
 * if a crash occurs that causes unsync'd data to be lost, whatever is left has the corresponding offset stored as well.
 * This means that in this case the indexing process that comes back having lost recent updates just resumes indexing
 * from what it has ensuring that no updates are lost.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Each record comes with its own offset, so to manage your own offset you just need to do the following:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Configure <code>enable.auto.commit=false</code>
 * <li>Use the offset provided with each {@link ConsumerRecord} to save your position.
 * <li>On restart restore the position of the consumer using {@link #seek(TopicPartition, long)}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This type of usage is simplest when the partition assignment is also done manually (this would be likely in the
 * search index use case described above). If the partition assignment is done automatically special care is
 * needed to handle the case where partition assignments change. This can be done by providing a
 * {@link ConsumerRebalanceListener} instance in the call to {@link #subscribe(Collection, ConsumerRebalanceListener)}
 * and {@link #subscribe(Pattern, ConsumerRebalanceListener)}.
 * For example, when partitions are taken from a consumer the consumer will want to commit its offset for those partitions by
 * implementing {@link ConsumerRebalanceListener#onPartitionsRevoked(Collection)}. When partitions are assigned to a
 * consumer, the consumer will want to look up the offset for those new partitions and correctly initialize the consumer
 * to that position by implementing {@link ConsumerRebalanceListener#onPartitionsAssigned(Collection)}.
 * <p>
 * Another common use for {@link ConsumerRebalanceListener} is to flush any caches the application maintains for
 * partitions that are moved elsewhere.
 *
 * <h4>Controlling The Consumer's Position</h4>
 *
 * In most use cases the consumer will simply consume records from beginning to end, periodically committing its
 * position (either automatically or manually). However Kafka allows the consumer to manually control its position,
 * moving forward or backwards in a partition at will. This means a consumer can re-consume older records, or skip to
 * the most recent records without actually consuming the intermediate records.
 * <p>
 * There are several instances where manually controlling the consumer's position can be useful.
 * <p>
 * One case is for time-sensitive record processing it may make sense for a consumer that falls far enough behind to not
 * attempt to catch up processing all records, but rather just skip to the most recent records.
 * <p>
 * Another use case is for a system that maintains local state as described in the previous section. In such a system
 * the consumer will want to initialize its position on start-up to whatever is contained in the local store. Likewise
 * if the local state is destroyed (say because the disk is lost) the state may be recreated on a new machine by
 * re-consuming all the data and recreating the state (assuming that Kafka is retaining sufficient history).
 * <p>
 * Kafka allows specifying the position using {@link #seek(TopicPartition, long)} to specify the new position. Special
 * methods for seeking to the earliest and latest offset the server maintains are also available (
 * {@link #seekToBeginning(Collection)} and {@link #seekToEnd(Collection)} respectively).
 *
 * <h4>Consumption Flow Control</h4>
 *
 * If a consumer is assigned multiple partitions to fetch data from, it will try to consume from all of them at the same time,
 * effectively giving these partitions the same priority for consumption. However in some cases consumers may want to
 * first focus on fetching from some subset of the assigned partitions at full speed, and only start fetching other partitions
 * when these partitions have few or no data to consume.
 *
 * <p>
 * One of such cases is stream processing, where processor fetches from two topics and performs the join on these two streams.
 * When one of the topics is long lagging behind the other, the processor would like to pause fetching from the ahead topic
 * in order to get the lagging stream to catch up. Another example is bootstrapping upon consumer starting up where there are
 * a lot of history data to catch up, the applications usually want to get the latest data on some of the topics before consider
 * fetching other topics.
 *
 * <p>
 * Kafka supports dynamic controlling of consumption flows by using {@link #pause(Collection)} and {@link #resume(Collection)}
 * to pause the consumption on the specified assigned partitions and resume the consumption
 * on the specified paused partitions respectively in the future {@link #poll(Duration)} calls.
 *
 * <h3>Reading Transactional Messages</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * Transactions were introduced in Kafka 0.11.0 wherein applications can write to multiple topics and partitions atomically.
 * In order for this to work, consumers reading from these partitions should be configured to only read committed data.
 * This can be achieved by setting the {@code isolation.level=read_committed} in the consumer's configuration.
 *
 * <p>
 * In <code>read_committed</code> mode, the consumer will read only those transactional messages which have been
 * successfully committed. It will continue to read non-transactional messages as before. There is no client-side
 * buffering in <code>read_committed</code> mode. Instead, the end offset of a partition for a <code>read_committed</code>
 * consumer would be the offset of the first message in the partition belonging to an open transaction. This offset
 * is known as the 'Last Stable Offset'(LSO).</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@code read_committed} consumer will only read up to the LSO and filter out any transactional
 * messages which have been aborted. The LSO also affects the behavior of {@link #seekToEnd(Collection)} and
 * {@link #endOffsets(Collection)} for {@code read_committed} consumers, details of which are in each method's documentation.
 * Finally, the fetch lag metrics are also adjusted to be relative to the LSO for {@code read_committed} consumers.
 *
 * <p>
 * Partitions with transactional messages will include commit or abort markers which indicate the result of a transaction.
 * There markers are not returned to applications, yet have an offset in the log. As a result, applications reading from
 * topics with transactional messages will see gaps in the consumed offsets. These missing messages would be the transaction
 * markers, and they are filtered out for consumers in both isolation levels. Additionally, applications using
 * {@code read_committed} consumers may also see gaps due to aborted transactions, since those messages would not
 * be returned by the consumer and yet would have valid offsets.
 *
 * <h3><a name="multithreaded">Multi-threaded Processing</a></h3>
 *
 * The Kafka consumer is NOT thread-safe. All network I/O happens in the thread of the application
 * making the call. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that multi-threaded access
 * is properly synchronized. Un-synchronized access will result in {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The only exception to this rule is {@link #wakeup()}, which can safely be used from an external thread to
 * interrupt an active operation. In this case, a {@link org.apache.kafka.common.errors.WakeupException} will be
 * thrown from the thread blocking on the operation. This can be used to shutdown the consumer from another thread.
 * The following snippet shows the typical pattern:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class KafkaConsumerRunner implements Runnable {
 *     private final AtomicBoolean closed = new AtomicBoolean(false);
 *     private final KafkaConsumer consumer;
 *
 *     public KafkaConsumerRunner(KafkaConsumer consumer) {
 *       this.consumer = consumer;
 *     }
 *
 *     {@literal}@Override
 *     public void run() {
 *         try {
 *             consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList("topic"));
 *             while (!closed.get()) {
 *                 ConsumerRecords records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(10000));
 *                 // Handle new records
 *             }
 *         } catch (WakeupException e) {
 *             // Ignore exception if closing
 *             if (!closed.get()) throw e;
 *         } finally {
 *             consumer.close();
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     // Shutdown hook which can be called from a separate thread
 *     public void shutdown() {
 *         closed.set(true);
 *         consumer.wakeup();
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Then in a separate thread, the consumer can be shutdown by setting the closed flag and waking up the consumer.
 *
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *     closed.set(true);
 *     consumer.wakeup();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that while it is possible to use thread interrupts instead of {@link #wakeup()} to abort a blocking operation
 * (in which case, {@link InterruptException} will be raised), we discourage their use since they may cause a clean
 * shutdown of the consumer to be aborted. Interrupts are mainly supported for those cases where using {@link #wakeup()}
 * is impossible, e.g. when a consumer thread is managed by code that is unaware of the Kafka client.
 *
 * <p>
 * We have intentionally avoided implementing a particular threading model for processing. This leaves several
 * options for implementing multi-threaded processing of records.
 *
 * <h4>1. One Consumer Per Thread</h4>
 *
 * A simple option is to give each thread its own consumer instance. Here are the pros and cons of this approach:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>PRO</b>: It is the easiest to implement
 * <li><b>PRO</b>: It is often the fastest as no inter-thread co-ordination is needed
 * <li><b>PRO</b>: It makes in-order processing on a per-partition basis very easy to implement (each thread just
 * processes messages in the order it receives them).
 * <li><b>CON</b>: More consumers means more TCP connections to the cluster (one per thread). In general Kafka handles
 * connections very efficiently so this is generally a small cost.
 * <li><b>CON</b>: Multiple consumers means more requests being sent to the server and slightly less batching of data
 * which can cause some drop in I/O throughput.
 * <li><b>CON</b>: The number of total threads across all processes will be limited by the total number of partitions.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h4>2. Decouple Consumption and Processing</h4>
 *
 * Another alternative is to have one or more consumer threads that do all data consumption and hands off
 * {@link ConsumerRecords} instances to a blocking queue consumed by a pool of processor threads that actually handle
 * the record processing.
 *
 * This option likewise has pros and cons:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>PRO</b>: This option allows independently scaling the number of consumers and processors. This makes it
 * possible to have a single consumer that feeds many processor threads, avoiding any limitation on partitions.
 * <li><b>CON</b>: Guaranteeing order across the processors requires particular care as the threads will execute
 * independently an earlier chunk of data may actually be processed after a later chunk of data just due to the luck of
 * thread execution timing. For processing that has no ordering requirements this is not a problem.
 * <li><b>CON</b>: Manually committing the position becomes harder as it requires that all threads co-ordinate to ensure
 * that processing is complete for that partition.
 * </ul>
 *
 * There are many possible variations on this approach. For example each processor thread can have its own queue, and
 * the consumer threads can hash into these queues using the TopicPartition to ensure in-order consumption and simplify
 * commit.
