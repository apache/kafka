/**
 * An index that maps offsets to physical file locations for a particular log segment. This index may be sparse:
 * that is it may not hold an entry for all messages in the log.
 *
 * The index is stored in a file that is pre-allocated to hold a fixed maximum number of 8-byte entries.
 *
 * The index supports lookups against a memory-map of this file. These lookups are done using a simple binary search variant
 * to locate the offset/location pair for the greatest offset less than or equal to the target offset.
 *
 * Index files can be opened in two ways: either as an empty, mutable index that allows appends or
 * an immutable read-only index file that has previously been populated. The makeReadOnly method will turn a mutable file into an
 * immutable one and truncate off any extra bytes. This is done when the index file is rolled over.
 *
 * No attempt is made to checksum the contents of this file, in the event of a crash it is rebuilt.
 *
 * The file format is a series of entries. The physical format is a 4 byte "relative" offset and a 4 byte file location for the
 * message with that offset. The offset stored is relative to the base offset of the index file. So, for example,
 * if the base offset was 50, then the offset 55 would be stored as 5. Using relative offsets in this way let's us use
 * only 4 bytes for the offset.
 *
 * The frequency of entries is up to the user of this class.
 *
 * All external APIs translate from relative offsets to full offsets, so users of this class do not interact with the internal
 * storage format.
