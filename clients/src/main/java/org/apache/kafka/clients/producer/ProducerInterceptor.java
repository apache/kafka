/**
 * A plugin interface that allows you to intercept (and possibly mutate) the records received by the producer before
 * they are published to the Kafka cluster.
 * <p>
 * This class will get producer config properties via <code>configure()</code> method, including clientId assigned
 * by KafkaProducer if not specified in the producer config. The interceptor implementation needs to be aware that it will be
 * sharing producer config namespace with other interceptors and serializers, and ensure that there are no conflicts.
 * <p>
 * Exceptions thrown by ProducerInterceptor methods will be caught, logged, but not propagated further. As a result, if
 * the user configures the interceptor with the wrong key and value type parameters, the producer will not throw an exception,
 * just log the errors.
 * <p>
 * ProducerInterceptor callbacks may be called from multiple threads. Interceptor implementation must ensure thread-safety, if needed.
 * <p>
 * Implement {@link org.apache.kafka.common.ClusterResourceListener} to receive cluster metadata once it's available. Please see the class documentation for ClusterResourceListener for more information.

     * get serialized and partition is assigned (if partition is not specified in ProducerRecord).
     * <p>
     * This method is allowed to modify the record, in which case, the new record will be returned. The implication of modifying
     * key/value is that partition assignment (if not specified in ProducerRecord) will be done based on modified key/value,
     * not key/value from the client. Consequently, key and value transformation done in onSend() needs to be consistent:
     * same key and value should mutate to the same (modified) key and value. Otherwise, log compaction would not work
     * as expected.
     * <p>
     * Similarly, it is up to interceptor implementation to ensure that correct topic/partition is returned in ProducerRecord.
     * Most often, it should be the same topic/partition from 'record'.
     * <p>
     * Any exception thrown by this method will be caught by the caller and logged, but not propagated further.
     * <p>
     * Since the producer may run multiple interceptors, a particular interceptor's onSend() callback will be called in the order
     * specified by {@link org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerConfig#INTERCEPTOR_CLASSES_CONFIG}. The first interceptor
     * in the list gets the record passed from the client, the following interceptor will be passed the record returned by the
     * previous interceptor, and so on. Since interceptors are allowed to modify records, interceptors may potentially get
     * the record already modified by other interceptors. However, building a pipeline of mutable interceptors that depend on the output
     * of the previous interceptor is discouraged, because of potential side-effects caused by interceptors potentially failing to
     * modify the record and throwing an exception. If one of the interceptors in the list throws an exception from onSend(), the exception
     * is caught, logged, and the next interceptor is called with the record returned by the last successful interceptor in the list,
     * or otherwise the client.
