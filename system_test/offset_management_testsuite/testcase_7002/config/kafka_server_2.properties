############################# Server Basics #############################

# The id of the broker. This must be set to a unique integer for each broker.
broker.id=2

# Hostname the broker will advertise to consumers. If not set, kafka will use the value returned
# from InetAddress.getLocalHost().  If there are multiple interfaces getLocalHost
# may not be what you want.
#host.name=


############################# Socket Server Settings #############################

# The port the socket server listens on
port=9092

# The number of threads handling network requests
num.network.threads=2
 
# The number of threads doing disk I/O
num.io.threads=2

# The send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) used by the socket server
socket.send.buffer.bytes=1048576

# The receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) used by the socket server
socket.receive.buffer.bytes=1048576

# The maximum size of a request that the socket server will accept (protection against OOM)
socket.request.max.bytes=104857600


############################# Log Basics #############################

# The directory under which to store log files
log.dir=/tmp/kafka_server_2_logs

# The default number of log partitions per topic. More partitions allow greater
# parallelism for consumption, but this will also result in more files across
# the brokers.
num.partitions=5

# Overrides for for the default given by num.partitions on a per-topic basis
#topic.partition.count.map=topic1:3, topic2:4

############################# Log Flush Policy #############################

# The following configurations control the flush of data to disk. This is the most
# important performance knob in kafka.
# There are a few important trade-offs here:
#    1. Durability: Unflushed data is at greater risk of loss in the event of a crash.
#    2. Latency: Data is not made available to consumers until it is flushed (which adds latency).
#    3. Throughput: The flush is generally the most expensive operation. 
# The settings below allow one to configure the flush policy to flush data after a period of time or
# every N messages (or both). This can be done globally and overridden on a per-topic basis.

# The number of messages to accept before forcing a flush of data to disk
log.flush.interval.messages=10000

# The maximum amount of time a message can sit in a log before we force a flush
log.flush.interval.ms=1000

# Per-topic overrides for log.flush.interval.ms
#log.flush.intervals.ms.per.topic=topic1:1000, topic2:3000

# The interval (in ms) at which logs are checked to see if they need to be flushed to disk.
log.flush.scheduler.interval.ms=1000

############################# Log Retention Policy #############################

# The following configurations control the disposal of log segments. The policy can
# be set to delete segments after a period of time, or after a given size has accumulated.
# A segment will be deleted whenever *either* of these criteria are met. Deletion always happens
# from the end of the log.

# The minimum age of a log file to be eligible for deletion
log.retention.hours=168

# A size-based retention policy for logs. Segments are pruned from the log as long as the remaining
# segments don't drop below log.retention.bytes.
#log.retention.bytes=1073741824
log.retention.bytes=-1

# The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is reached a new log segment will be created.
#log.segment.size=536870912
log.segment.bytes=10240

# The interval at which log segments are checked to see if they can be deleted according 
# to the retention policies
log.cleanup.interval.mins=1

############################# Zookeeper #############################

# Enable connecting to zookeeper
enable.zookeeper=true

# Zk connection string (see zk docs for details).
# This is a comma separated host:port pairs, each corresponding to a zk
# server. e.g. "127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002".
# You can also append an optional chroot string to the urls to specify the
# root directory for all kafka znodes.
zookeeper.connect=localhost:2108
