/**
 * The {@code Transformer} interface is for stateful mapping of an input record to zero, one, or multiple new output
 * records (both key and value type can be altered arbitrarily).
 * This is a stateful record-by-record operation, i.e, {@link #transform(Object, Object)} is invoked individually for
 * each record of a stream and can access and modify a state that is available beyond a single call of
 * {@link #transform(Object, Object)} (cf. {@link KeyValueMapper} for stateless record transformation).
 * Additionally, this {@code Transformer} can {@link ProcessorContext#schedule(Duration, PunctuationType, Punctuator) schedule}
 * a method to be {@link Punctuator#punctuate(long) called periodically} with the provided context.
 * <p>
 * Use {@link TransformerSupplier} to provide new instances of {@code Transformer} to Kafka Stream's runtime.
 * <p>
 * If only a record's value should be modified {@link ValueTransformer} can be used.
 *
 * @param <K> key type
 * @param <V> value type
 * @param <R> {@link KeyValue} return type (both key and value type can be set
 *            arbitrarily)
 * @see TransformerSupplier
 * @see ValueTransformer
 * @see KStream#map(KeyValueMapper)
 * @see KStream#flatMap(KeyValueMapper)
 * @deprecated Since 4.0. Use {@link org.apache.kafka.streams.processor.api.Processor api.Processor} instead.
