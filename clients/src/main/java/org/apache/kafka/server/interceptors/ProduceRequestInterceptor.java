/**
 * ProduceRequestInterceptors can be defined to perform custom, light-weight processing on every record received by a
 * broker.
 *
 * Broker-side interceptors should be used with caution:
 *  1. Processing messages that were sent in compressed format by the producer will need to be decompressed and then
 *    re-compressed to perform broker-side processing
 *  2. Performing unduly long or complex computations can negatively impact overall cluster health and performance
 *
 * Potential use cases:
 *   - Schema validation
 *   - Privacy enforcement
 *   - Decoupling server-side and client-side serialization
