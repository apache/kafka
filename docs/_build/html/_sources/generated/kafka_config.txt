<tr>
<td>listener.security.protocol.map</td><td>Map between listener names and security protocols. This must be defined for the same security protocol to be usable in more than one port or IP. For example, internal and external traffic can be separated even if SSL is required for both. Concretely, the user could define listeners with names INTERNAL and EXTERNAL and this property as: `INTERNAL:SSL,EXTERNAL:SSL`. As shown, key and value are separated by a colon and map entries are separated by commas. Each listener name should only appear once in the map. Different security (SSL and SASL) settings can be configured for each listener by adding a normalised prefix (the listener name is lowercased) to the config name. For example, to set a different keystore for the INTERNAL listener, a config with name `listener.name.internal.ssl.keystore.location` would be set. If the config for the listener name is not set, the config will fallback to the generic config (i.e. `ssl.keystore.location`). </td><td>string</td><td>PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,SSL:SSL,SASL_PLAINTEXT:SASL_PLAINTEXT,SASL_SSL:SASL_SSL</td><td></td><td>low</td></tr>
