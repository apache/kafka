# See http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#brokerconfigs for default values.

# Each broker is uniquely identified by a non-negative integer id.  This id serves as the brokers "name", and allows
# the broker to be moved to a different host/port without confusing consumers. You can choose any number you like so
# long as it is unique.

# Hostname of broker. If this is set, it will only bind to this address.  If this is not set, it will bind to all
# interfaces, and publish one to ZK.

# The port on which the server accepts client connections.
port=9092

# The default number of partitions per topic.
#
num.partitions=1

# Enable auto creation of topic on the server. If this is set to true then attempts to produce, consume, or fetch
# metadata for a non-existent topic will automatically create it with the default replication factor and number of
# partitions.

# The maximum size of a message that the server can receive.  It is important that this property be in sync with the
# maximum fetch size your consumers use or else an unruly consumer will be able to publish messages too large for
# consumers to consume.

# Be careful with this setting when producing messages in batches with compression enabled.  In such a scenario the
# batch of messages is treated as a single message, and its total size must be smaller than this setting.
