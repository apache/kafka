Tool to bring up a vagrant cluster on local machine or aws.

    -h | --help             Show this help message
    --aws                   Use if you are running in aws
    --no-parallel           Bring up machines not in parallel. Only applicable on aws
    --max-parallel  MAX     Maximum number of machines to bring up in parallel. Note: only applicable on test worker machines on aws. default: $MAX_PARALLEL
    --debug                 Enable debug information for vagrant
Approximately speaking, this wrapper script essentially wraps 2 commands:
    vagrant up
    vagrant hostmanager

The situation on aws is complicated by the fact that aws imposes a maximum request rate,
which effectively caps the number of machines we are able to bring up in parallel. Therefore, on aws,
this wrapper script attempts to bring up machines in small batches.

If you are seeing rate limit exceeded errors, you may need to use a reduced --max-parallel setting.
