/**
  * This is the main test which ensure Replication Quotas work correctly.
  *
  * The test will fail if the quota is < 1MB/s as 1MB is the default for replica.fetch.max.bytes.
  * So with a throttle of 100KB/s, 1 fetch of 1 partition would fill 10s of quota. In turn causing
  * the throttled broker to pause for > 10s
  *
  * Anything over 100MB/s tends to fail as this is the non-throttled replication rate
