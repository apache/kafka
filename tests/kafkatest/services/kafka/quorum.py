    Exposes quorum-related information for a KafkaService

    Kafka can use either ZooKeeper or a KRaft (Kafka Raft) Controller quorum for
    its metadata.  KRaft Controllers can either be combined with Kafka in
    the same JVM or isolated in separate JVMs.  The choice is made via
    the 'metadata_quorum' parameter defined for the system test: if it
    is not explicitly defined, or if it is set to 'ZK', then ZooKeeper
    is used.  If it is explicitly set to 'COMBINED_KRAFT' then KRaft
    controllers will be combined with the brokers; the value
    `ISOLATED_KRAFT` indicates isolated controllers.
