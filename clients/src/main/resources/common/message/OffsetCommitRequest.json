  // Version 1 adds timestamp and group membership information, as well as the commit timestamp.
  //
  // Version 2 adds retention time.  It removes the commit timestamp added in version 1.
  //
  // Version 3 and 4 are the same as version 2. 
  //
  // Version 5 removes the retention time, which is now controlled only by a broker configuration.
  //
  // Version 6 adds the leader epoch for fencing.
  //
  // version 7 adds a new field called groupInstanceId to indicate member identity across restarts.
  //
  // Version 8 is the first flexible version.
  //
  // Version 9 is the first version that can be used with the new consumer group protocol (KIP-848). The
  // request is the same as version 8.
  // Version 9 is added as part of KIP-848 and is still under development. Hence, the last version of the
  // API is not exposed by default by brokers unless explicitly enabled.
