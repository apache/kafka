/**
 * SinkTask is a Task that takes records loaded from Kafka and sends them to another system. Each task
 * instance is assigned a set of partitions by the Connect framework and will handle all records received
 * from those partitions. As records are fetched from Kafka, they will be passed to the sink task using the
 * {@link #put(Collection)} API, which should either write them to the downstream system or batch them for
 * later writing. Periodically, Connect will call {@link #flush(Map)} to ensure that batched records are
 * actually pushed to the downstream system..
 *
 * Below we describe the lifecycle of a SinkTask.
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li><b>Initialization:</b> SinkTasks are first initialized using {@link #initialize(SinkTaskContext)}
 *     to prepare the task's context and {@link #start(Map)} to accept configuration and start any services
 *     needed for processing.</li>
 *     <li><b>Partition Assignment:</b> After initialization, Connect will assign the task a set of partitions
 *     using {@link #open(Collection)}. These partitions are owned exclusively by this task until they
 *     have been closed with {@link #close(Collection)}.</li>
 *     <li><b>Record Processing:</b> Once partitions have been opened for writing, Connect will begin forwarding
 *     records from Kafka using the {@link #put(Collection)} API. Periodically, Connect will ask the task
 *     to flush records using {@link #flush(Map)} as described above.</li>
 *     <li><b>Partition Rebalancing:</b> Occasionally, Connect will need to change the assignment of this task.
 *     When this happens, the currently assigned partitions will be closed with {@link #close(Collection)} and
 *     the new assignment will be opened using {@link #open(Collection)}.</li>
 *     <li><b>Shutdown:</b> When the task needs to be shutdown, Connect will close active partitions (if there
 *     are any) and stop the task using {@link #stop()}</li>
  * </ol>
