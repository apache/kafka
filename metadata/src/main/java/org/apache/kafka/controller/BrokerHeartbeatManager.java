/**
 * The BrokerHeartbeatManager manages some of the soft state associated with broker heartbeats.
 * For example, it stores the last metadata offset which each broker reported. It contains the
 * BrokerHeartbeatTracker, which stores the last time we received a heartbeat from each broker.
 * In addition to storing this soft state, the BrokerHeartbeatManager aggregates some information
 * about brokers (such as whether they're fenced or not) into a single place.
 *
 * Only the active controller has a BrokerHeartbeatManager, since only the active
 * controller handles broker heartbeats.  Standby controllers will create a heartbeat
 * manager as part of the process of activating.  This design minimizes the size of the
 * metadata partition by excluding heartbeats from it.  However, it does mean that after
 * a controller failover, we may take some extra time to fence brokers, since the new
 * active controller does not know when the last heartbeats were received from each.
