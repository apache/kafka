  /*
   Kafka mmaps index files into memory, and all the read / write operations of the index is through OS page cache. This
   avoids blocked disk I/O in most cases.

   To the extent of our knowledge, all the modern operating systems use LRU policy or its variants to manage page
   cache. Kafka always appends to the end of the index file, and almost all the index lookups (typically from in-sync
   followers or consumers) are very close to the end of the index. So, the LRU cache replacement policy should work very
   well with Kafka's index access pattern.

   However, when looking up index, the standard binary search algorithm is not cache friendly, and can cause unnecessary
   page faults (the thread is blocked to wait for reading some index entries from hard disk, as those entries are not
   cached in the page cache).

   For example, in an index with 13 pages, to lookup an entry in the last page (page #12), the standard binary search
   algorithm will read index entries in page #0, 6, 9, 11, and 12.
   page number: |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12 |
   steps:       |1| | | | | |3| | |4|  |5 |2/6|
   In each page, there are hundreds log entries, corresponding to hundreds to thousands of kafka messages. When the
   index gradually growing from the 1st entry in page #12 to the last entry in page #12, all the write (append)
   operations are in page #12, and all the in-sync follower / consumer lookups read page #0,6,9,11,12. As these pages
   are always used in each in-sync lookup, we can assume these pages are fairly recently used, and are very likely to be
   in the page cache. When the index grows to page #13, the pages needed in a in-sync lookup change to #0, 7, 10, 12,
   and 13:
   page number: |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13 |
   steps:       |1| | | | | | |3| | | 4|5 | 6|2/7|
   Page #7 and page #10 have not been used for a very long time. They are much less likely to be in the page cache, than
   the other pages. The 1st lookup, after the 1st index entry in page #13 is appended, is likely to have to read page #7
   and page #10 from disk (page fault), which can take up to more than a second. In our test, this can cause the
   at-least-once produce latency to jump to about 1 second from a few ms.

   Here, we use a more cache-friendly lookup algorithm:
   if (target > indexEntry[end - N]) // if the target is in the last N entries of the index
      binarySearch(end - N, end)
   else
      binarySearch(begin, end - N)

   If possible, we only look up in the last N entries of the index. By choosing a proper constant N, all the in-sync
   lookups should go to the 1st branch. We call the last N entries the "warm" section. As we frequently look up in this
   relatively small section, the pages containing this section are more likely to be in the page cache.

   We set N (_warmEntries) to 8192, because
   1. This number is small enough to guarantee all the pages of the "warm" section is touched in every warm-section
      lookup. So that, the entire warm section is really "warm".
      When doing warm-section lookup, following 3 entries are always touched: indexEntry(end), indexEntry(end-N),
      and indexEntry((end*2 -N)/2). If page size >= 4096, all the warm-section pages (3 or fewer) are touched, when we
      touch those 3 entries. As of 2018, 4096 is the smallest page size for all the processors (x86-32, x86-64, MIPS,
      SPARC, Power, ARM etc.).
   2. This number is large enough to guarantee most of the in-sync lookups are in the warm-section. With default Kafka
      settings, 8KB index corresponds to about 4MB (offset index) or 2.7MB (time index) log messages.

   We can't set make N (_warmEntries) to be larger than 8192, as there is no simple way to guarantee all the "warm"
   section pages are really warm (touched in every lookup) on a typical 4KB-page host.

   In there future, we may use a backend thread to periodically touch the entire warm section. So that, we can
   1) support larger warm section
   2) make sure the warm section of low QPS topic-partitions are really warm.
