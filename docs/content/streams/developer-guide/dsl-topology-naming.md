# Naming Operators in a Kafka Streams DSL Application {#naming}

You now can give names to processors when using the Kafka Streams DSL.
In the PAPI there are `Processors` and `State Stores` and you are
required to explicitly name each one.

At the DSL layer, there are operators. A single DSL operator may compile
down to multiple `Processors` and `State Stores`, and if required
`repartition topics`. But with the Kafka Streams DSL, all these names
are generated for you. There is a relationship between the generated
processor name state store names (hence changelog topic names) and
repartition topic names. Note, that the names of state stores and
changelog/repartition topics are \"stateful\" while processor names are
\"stateless\".

This distinction of stateful vs. stateless names has important
implications when updating your topology. While the internal naming
makes creating a topology with the DSL much more straightforward, there
are a couple of trade-offs. The first trade-off is what we could
consider a readability issue. The other more severe trade-off is the
shifting of names due to the relationship between the DSL operator and
the generated `Processors`, `State Stores` changelog topics and
repartition topics.

## Readability Issues

By saying there is a readability trade-off, we are referring to viewing
a description of the topology. When you render the string description of
your topology via the `Topology#desribe()` method, you can see what the
processor is, but you don\'t have any context for its business purpose.
For example, consider the following simple topology:\

```java line-numbers
KStream<String,String> stream = builder.stream("input");
stream.filter((k,v) -> !v.equals("invalid_txn"))
      .mapValues((v) -> v.substring(0,5))
      .to("output");
```

Running `Topology#describe()` yields this string:

```
Topologies:
   Sub-topology: 0
    Source: KSTREAM-SOURCE-0000000000 (topics: [input])
      --> KSTREAM-FILTER-0000000001
    Processor: KSTREAM-FILTER-0000000001 (stores: [])
      --> KSTREAM-MAPVALUES-0000000002
      <-- KSTREAM-SOURCE-0000000000
    Processor: KSTREAM-MAPVALUES-0000000002 (stores: [])
      --> KSTREAM-SINK-0000000003
      <-- KSTREAM-FILTER-0000000001
    Sink: KSTREAM-SINK-0000000003 (topic: output)
      <-- KSTREAM-MAPVALUES-0000000002
```

From this report, you can see what the different operators are, but what
is the broader context here? For example, consider
`KSTREAM-FILTER-0000000001`, we can see that it\'s a filter operation,
which means that records are dropped that don\'t match the given
predicate. But what is the meaning of the predicate? Additionally, you
can see the topic names of the source and sink nodes, but what if the
topics aren\'t named in a meaningful way? Then you\'re left to guess the
business purpose behind these topics.

Also notice the numbering here: the source node is suffixed with
`0000000000` indicating it\'s the first processor in the topology. The
filter is suffixed with `0000000001`, indicating it\'s the second
processor in the topology. In Kafka Streams, there are now overloaded
methods for both `KStream` and `KTable` that accept a new parameter
`Named`. By using the `Named` class DSL users can provide meaningful
names to the processors in their topology.

Now let\'s take a look at your topology with all the processors named:

```java line-numbers
KStream<String,String> stream =
builder.stream("input", Consumed.as("Customer_transactions_input_topic"));
stream.filter((k,v) -> !v.equals("invalid_txn"), Named.as("filter_out_invalid_txns"))
      .mapValues((v) -> v.substring(0,5), Named.as("Map_values_to_first_6_characters"))
      .to("output", Produced.as("Mapped_transactions_output_topic"));
```

```
Topologies:
   Sub-topology: 0
    Source: Customer_transactions_input_topic (topics: [input])
      --> filter_out_invalid_txns
    Processor: filter_out_invalid_txns (stores: [])
      --> Map_values_to_first_6_characters
      <-- Customer_transactions_input_topic
    Processor: Map_values_to_first_6_characters (stores: [])
      --> Mapped_transactions_output_topic
      <-- filter_out_invalid_txns
    Sink: Mapped_transactions_output_topic (topic: output)
      <-- Map_values_to_first_6_characters
```

Now you can look at the topology description and easily understand what
role each processor plays in the topology. But there\'s another reason
for naming your processor nodes when you have stateful operators that
remain between restarts of your Kafka Streams applications, state
stores, changelog topics, and repartition topics.

## Changing Names

Generated names are numbered where they are built in the topology. The
name generation strategy is
`KSTREAM|KTABLE->operator name<->number suffix<`. The number is a
globally incrementing number that represents the operator\'s order in
the topology. The generated number is prefixed with a varying number of
\"0\"s to create a string that is consistently 10 characters long. This
means that if you add/remove or shift the order of operations, the
position of the processor shifts, which shifts the name of the
processor. Since **most** processors exist in memory only, this name
shifting presents no issue for many topologies. But the name shifting
does have implications for topologies with stateful operators or
repartition topics. Here\'s a different topology with some state:

```java line-numbers
KStream<String,String> stream = builder.stream("input");
 stream.groupByKey()
       .count()
       .toStream()
       .to("output");
```

This topology description yields the following:

```
Topologies:
   Sub-topology: 0
    Source: KSTREAM-SOURCE-0000000000 (topics: [input])
     --> KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-0000000002
    Processor: KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-0000000002 (stores: [KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-STATE-STORE-0000000001])
     --> KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000003
     <-- KSTREAM-SOURCE-0000000000
    Processor: KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000003 (stores: [])
     --> KSTREAM-SINK-0000000004
     <-- KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-0000000002
    Sink: KSTREAM-SINK-0000000004 (topic: output)
     <-- KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000003
```

You can see from the topology description above that the state store is
named `KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-STATE-STORE-0000000002`. Here\'s what happens
when you add a filter to keep some of the records out of the
aggregation:

```java line-numbers
KStream<String,String> stream = builder.stream("input");
stream.filter((k,v)-> v !=null && v.length() >= 6 )
      .groupByKey()
      .count()
      .toStream()
      .to("output");
```

And the corresponding topology:

```
Topologies:
    Sub-topology: 0
     Source: KSTREAM-SOURCE-0000000000 (topics: [input])
      --> KSTREAM-FILTER-0000000001
     Processor: KSTREAM-FILTER-0000000001 (stores: [])
       --> KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-0000000003
       <-- KSTREAM-SOURCE-0000000000
     Processor: KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-0000000003 (stores: [KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-STATE-STORE-0000000002])
       --> KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000004
       <-- KSTREAM-FILTER-0000000001
     Processor: KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000004 (stores: [])
       --> KSTREAM-SINK-0000000005
       <-- KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-0000000003
      Sink: KSTREAM-SINK-0000000005 (topic: output)
       <-- KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000004
```

Notice that since you\'ve added an operation *before* the `count`
operation, the state store (and the changelog topic) names have changed.
This name change means you can\'t do a rolling re-deployment of your
updated topology. Also, you must use the 
[Streams Reset Tool](../app-reset-tool)
to re-calculate the aggregations, because the changelog topic has
changed on start-up and the new changelog topic contains no data.
Fortunately, there\'s an easy solution to remedy this situation. Give
the state store a user-defined name instead of relying on the generated
one, so you don\'t have to worry about topology changes shifting the
name of the state store. You\'ve had the ability to name repartition
topics with the `Joined`, `StreamJoined`, and`Grouped` classes, and name
state store and changelog topics with `Materialized`. But it\'s worth
reiterating the importance of naming these DSL topology operations
again. Here\'s how your DSL code looks now giving a specific name to
your state store:

```java line-numbers
KStream<String,String> stream = builder.stream("input");
stream.filter((k, v) -> v != null && v.length() >= 6)
      .groupByKey()
      .count(Materialized.as("Purchase_count_store"))
      .toStream()
      .to("output");
```

And here\'s the topology

```
Topologies:
   Sub-topology: 0
    Source: KSTREAM-SOURCE-0000000000 (topics: [input])
      --> KSTREAM-FILTER-0000000001
    Processor: KSTREAM-FILTER-0000000001 (stores: [])
      --> KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-0000000002
      <-- KSTREAM-SOURCE-0000000000
    Processor: KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-0000000002 (stores: [Purchase_count_store])
      --> KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000003
      <-- KSTREAM-FILTER-0000000001
    Processor: KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000003 (stores: [])
      --> KSTREAM-SINK-0000000004
      <-- KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-0000000002
    Sink: KSTREAM-SINK-0000000004 (topic: output)
      <-- KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000003
```

Now, even though you\'ve added processors before your state store, the
store name and its changelog topic names don\'t change. This makes your
topology more robust and resilient to changes made by adding or removing
processors.

## Conclusion

It\'s a good practice to name your processing nodes when using the DSL,
and it\'s even more important to do this when you have \"stateful\"
processors your application such as repartition topics and state stores
(and the accompanying changelog topics).

Here are a couple of points to remember when naming your DSL topology:

1.  If you have an *existing topology* and you *haven\'t* named your
    state stores (and changelog topics) and repartition topics, we
    recommended that you do so. But this will be a topology breaking
    change, so you\'ll need to shut down all application instances, make
    the changes, and run the 
    [Streams Reset Tool](../app-reset-tool).
    Although this may be inconvenient at first, it\'s worth the effort
    to protect your application from unexpected errors due to topology
    changes.
2.  If you have a *new topology*, make sure you name the persistent
    parts of your topology: state stores (changelog topics) and
    repartition topics. This way, when you deploy your application,
    you\'re protected from topology changes that otherwise would break
    your Kafka Streams application. If you don\'t want to add names to
    stateless processors at first, that\'s fine as you can always go
    back and add the names later.

Here\'s a quick reference on naming the critical parts of your Kafka
Streams application to prevent topology name changes from breaking your
application:

| Operation                                               | Naming Class |
|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Aggregation repartition topics                          | Grouped      |
| KStream-KStream Join repartition topics                 | StreamJoined |
| KStream-KTable Join repartition topic                   | Joined       |
| KStream-KStream Join state stores                       | StreamJoined |
| State Stores (for aggregations and KTable-KTable joins) | Materialized |
| Stream/Table non-stateful operations                    | Named        |
