   * to deliver only the final result. This option is suitable for use cases in which the business logic

   * To accomplish this, the operator will buffer events from the window until the window close (that is,
   * until the end-time passes, and additionally until the grace period expires). Since windowed operators
   * are required to reject late events for a window whose grace period is expired, there is an additional
