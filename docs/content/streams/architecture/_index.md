# Architecture

Kafka Streams simplifies application development by building on the
Kafka producer and consumer libraries and leveraging the native
capabilities of Kafka to offer data parallelism, distributed
coordination, fault tolerance, and operational simplicity. In this
section, we describe how Kafka Streams works underneath the covers.

The picture below shows the anatomy of an application that uses the
Kafka Streams library. Let\'s walk through some details.

## Stream Partitions and Tasks {#streams_architecture_tasks .anchor-link}

The messaging layer of Kafka partitions data for storing and
transporting it. Kafka Streams partitions data for processing it. In
both cases, this partitioning is what enables data locality, elasticity,
scalability, high performance, and fault tolerance. Kafka Streams uses
the concepts of **partitions** and **tasks** as logical units of its
parallelism model based on Kafka topic partitions. There are close links
between Kafka Streams and Kafka in the context of parallelism:

-   Each **stream partition** is a totally ordered sequence of data
    records and maps to a Kafka **topic partition**.
-   A **data record** in the stream maps to a Kafka **message** from
    that topic.
-   The **keys** of data records determine the partitioning of data in
    both Kafka and Kafka Streams, i.e., how data is routed to specific
    partitions within topics.

An application\'s processor topology is scaled by breaking it into
multiple tasks. More specifically, Kafka Streams creates a fixed number
of tasks based on the input stream partitions for the application, with
each task assigned a list of partitions from the input streams (i.e.,
Kafka topics). The assignment of partitions to tasks never changes so
that each task is a fixed unit of parallelism of the application. Tasks
can then instantiate their own processor topology based on the assigned
partitions; they also maintain a buffer for each of its assigned
partitions and process messages one-at-a-time from these record buffers.
As a result stream tasks can be processed independently and in parallel
without manual intervention.

Slightly simplified, the maximum parallelism at which your application
may run is bounded by the maximum number of stream tasks, which itself
is determined by maximum number of partitions of the input topic(s) the
application is reading from. For example, if your input topic has 5
partitions, then you can run up to 5 applications instances. These
instances will collaboratively process the topic\'s data. If you run a
larger number of app instances than partitions of the input topic, the
\"excess\" app instances will launch but remain idle; however, if one of
the busy instances goes down, one of the idle instances will resume the
former\'s work.

It is important to understand that Kafka Streams is not a resource
manager, but a library that \"runs\" anywhere its stream processing
application runs. Multiple instances of the application are executed
either on the same machine, or spread across multiple machines and tasks
can be distributed automatically by the library to those running
application instances. The assignment of partitions to tasks never
changes; if an application instance fails, all its assigned tasks will
be automatically restarted on other instances and continue to consume
from the same stream partitions.

**NOTE:** Topic partitions are assigned to tasks, and tasks are assigned
to all threads over all instances, in a best-effort attempt to trade off
load-balancing and stickiness of stateful tasks. For this assignment,
Kafka Streams uses the
[StreamsPartitionAssignor](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/{{<param akDotVersion>}}/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/processor/internals/StreamsPartitionAssignor.java)
class and doesn\'t let you change to a different assignor. If you try to
use a different assignor, Kafka Streams ignores it.

The following diagram shows two tasks each assigned with one partition
of the input streams.

## Threading Model {#streams_architecture_threads .anchor-link}

Kafka Streams allows the user to configure the number of **threads**
that the library can use to parallelize processing within an application
instance. Each thread can execute one or more tasks with their processor
topologies independently. For example, the following diagram shows one
stream thread running two stream tasks.

Starting more stream threads or more instances of the application merely
amounts to replicating the topology and having it process a different
subset of Kafka partitions, effectively parallelizing processing. It is
worth noting that there is no shared state amongst the threads, so no
inter-thread coordination is necessary. This makes it very simple to run
topologies in parallel across the application instances and threads. The
assignment of Kafka topic partitions amongst the various stream threads
is transparently handled by Kafka Streams leveraging 
[Kafka\'s coordination](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Kafka+Client-side+Assignment+Proposal)
functionality.

As we described above, scaling your stream processing application with
Kafka Streams is easy: you merely need to start additional instances of
your application, and Kafka Streams takes care of distributing
partitions amongst tasks that run in the application instances. You can
start as many threads of the application as there are input Kafka topic
partitions so that, across all running instances of an application,
every thread (or rather, the tasks it runs) has at least one input
partition to process.

As of Kafka 2.8 you can scale stream threads much in the same way you
can scale your Kafka Stream clients. Simply add or remove stream threads
and Kafka Streams will take care of redistributing the partitions. You
may also add threads to replace stream threads that have died removing
the need to restart clients to recover the number of thread running.

## Local State Stores {#streams_architecture_state .anchor-link}

Kafka Streams provides so-called **state stores**, which can be used by
stream processing applications to store and query data, which is an
important capability when implementing stateful operations. The 
[Kafka Streams DSL](../developer-guide/dsl-api),
for example, automatically creates and manages such state stores when
you are calling stateful operators such as `join()` or `aggregate()`, or
when you are windowing a stream.

Every stream task in a Kafka Streams application may embed one or more
local state stores that can be accessed via APIs to store and query data
required for processing. Kafka Streams offers fault-tolerance and
automatic recovery for such local state stores.

The following diagram shows two stream tasks with their dedicated local
state stores.

## Fault Tolerance {#streams_architecture_recovery .anchor-link}

Kafka Streams builds on fault-tolerance capabilities integrated natively
within Kafka. Kafka partitions are highly available and replicated; so
when stream data is persisted to Kafka it is available even if the
application fails and needs to re-process it. Tasks in Kafka Streams
leverage the fault-tolerance capability offered by the Kafka consumer
client to handle failures. If a task runs on a machine that fails, Kafka
Streams automatically restarts the task in one of the remaining running
instances of the application.

In addition, Kafka Streams makes sure that the local state stores are
robust to failures, too. For each state store, it maintains a replicated
changelog Kafka topic in which it tracks any state updates. These
changelog topics are partitioned as well so that each local state store
instance, and hence the task accessing the store, has its own dedicated
changelog topic partition. 
[Log compaction](../../design#compaction) is enabled
on the changelog topics so that old data can be purged safely to prevent
the topics from growing indefinitely. If tasks run on a machine that
fails and are restarted on another machine, Kafka Streams guarantees to
restore their associated state stores to the content before the failure
by replaying the corresponding changelog topics prior to resuming the
processing on the newly started tasks. As a result, failure handling is
completely transparent to the end user.

Note that the cost of task (re)initialization typically depends
primarily on the time for restoring the state by replaying the state
stores\' associated changelog topics. To minimize this restoration time,
users can configure their applications to have **standby replicas** of
local states (i.e. fully replicated copies of the state). When a task
migration happens, Kafka Streams will assign a task to an application
instance where such a standby replica already exists in order to
minimize the task (re)initialization cost. See `num.standby.replicas` in
the [**Kafka Streams Configs**](../../configuration#streamsconfigs) section.
Starting in 2.6, Kafka Streams will guarantee that a task is only ever
assigned to an instance with a fully caught-up local copy of the state,
if such an instance exists. Standby tasks will increase the likelihood
that a caught-up instance exists in the case of a failure.

You can also configure standby replicas with rack awareness. When
configured, Kafka Streams will attempt to distribute a standby task on a
different \"rack\" than the active one, thus having a faster recovery
time when the rack of the active tasks fails. See
`rack.aware.assignment.tags` in the 
[**Kafka Streams Developer Guide**](../developer-guide/config-streams#rack-aware-assignment-tags)
section.
