/**
 * {@code KStream} is an abstraction of a <i>record stream</i> of {@link KeyValue} pairs, i.e., each record is an
 * independent entity/event in the real world.
 * For example a user X might buy two items I1 and I2, and thus there might be two records {@code <K:I1>, <K:I2>}
 * in the stream.
 * <p>
 * A {@code KStream} is either {@link StreamsBuilder#stream(String) defined from one or multiple Kafka topics} that
 * are consumed message by message or the result of a {@code KStream} transformation.
 * A {@link KTable} can also be {@link KTable#toStream() converted} into a {@code KStream}.
 * <p>
 * A {@code KStream} can be transformed record by record, joined with another {@code KStream}, {@link KTable},
 * {@link GlobalKTable}, or can be aggregated into a {@link KTable}.
 * Kafka Streams DSL can be mixed-and-matched with Processor API (PAPI) (c.f. {@link Topology}) via
 * {@link #process(ProcessorSupplier, String...) process(...)} and
 * {@link #processValues(FixedKeyProcessorSupplier, String...) processValues(...)}.
 *
 * @param <K> Type of keys
 * @param <V> Type of values
 * @see KTable
 * @see KGroupedStream
 * @see StreamsBuilder#stream(String)

     * A {@link ValueTransformer} (provided by the given {@link ValueTransformerSupplier}) is applied to each input
     * record value and computes zero or more new values.
     * Thus, an input record {@code <K,V>} can be transformed into output records {@code <K:V'>, <K:V''>, ...}.
     * Attaching a state store makes this a stateful record-by-record operation (cf. {@link #mapValues(ValueMapper) mapValues()}).
     * If you choose not to attach one, this operation is similar to the stateless {@link #mapValues(ValueMapper) mapValues()}
     * but allows access to the {@code ProcessorContext} and record metadata.
     * This is essentially mixing the Processor API into the DSL, and provides all the functionality of the PAPI.
     * Furthermore, via {@link org.apache.kafka.streams.processor.Punctuator#punctuate(long) Punctuator#punctuate()}
     * the processing progress can be observed and additional periodic actions can be performed.
     * <p>
     * In order for the transformer to use state stores, the stores must be added to the topology and connected to the
     * transformer using at least one of two strategies (though it's not required to connect global state stores; read-only
     * access to global state stores is available by default).
     * <p>
     * The first strategy is to manually add the {@link StoreBuilder}s via {@link Topology#addStateStore(StoreBuilder, String...)},
     * and specify the store names via {@code stateStoreNames} so they will be connected to the transformer.
     * <pre>{@code
     * // create store
     * StoreBuilder<KeyValueStore<String,String>> keyValueStoreBuilder =
     *         Stores.keyValueStoreBuilder(Stores.persistentKeyValueStore("myValueTransformState"),
     *                 Serdes.String(),
     *                 Serdes.String());
     * // add store
     * builder.addStateStore(keyValueStoreBuilder);
     *
     * KStream outputStream = inputStream.flatTransformValues(new ValueTransformerSupplier() {
     *     public ValueTransformer get() {
     *         return new MyValueTransformer();
     *     }
     * }, "myValueTransformState");
     * }</pre>
     * The second strategy is for the given {@link ValueTransformerSupplier} to implement {@link ConnectedStoreProvider#stores()},
     * which provides the {@link StoreBuilder}s to be automatically added to the topology and connected to the transformer.
     * <pre>{@code
     * class MyValueTransformerSupplier implements ValueTransformerSupplier {
     *     // supply transformer
     *     ValueTransformerWithKey get() {
     *         return new MyValueTransformerWithKey();
     *     }
     *
     *     // provide store(s) that will be added and connected to the associated transformer
     *     // the store name from the builder ("myValueTransformState") is used to access the store later via the ProcessorContext
     *     Set<StoreBuilder> stores() {
     *         StoreBuilder<KeyValueStore<String, String>> keyValueStoreBuilder =
     *                   Stores.keyValueStoreBuilder(Stores.persistentKeyValueStore("myValueTransformState"),
     *                   Serdes.String(),
     *                   Serdes.String());
     *         return Collections.singleton(keyValueStoreBuilder);
     *     }
     * }
     *
     * ...
     *
     * KStream outputStream = inputStream.flatTransformValues(new MyValueTransformer());
     * }</pre>
     * <p>
     * With either strategy, within the {@link ValueTransformer}, the state is obtained via the {@link ProcessorContext}.
