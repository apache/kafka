    Note that consuming is a bit tricky, at least with console consumer. The goal is to consume all messages
    (foreach partition) in the topic. In this case, waiting for the last message may cause the consumer to stop
    too soon since console consumer is consuming multiple partitions from a single thread and therefore we lose
    ordering guarantees.

    Waiting on a count of consumed messages can be unreliable: if we stop consuming when num_consumed == num_acked,
    we might exit early if some messages are duplicated (though not an issue here since producer retries==0)

    Therefore rely here on the consumer.timeout.ms setting which times out on the interval between successively
    consumed messages. Since we run the producer to completion before running the consumer, this is a reliable
    indicator that nothing is left to consume.
