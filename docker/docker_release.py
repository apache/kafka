Python script to build and push a multiarch docker image
This script is used to prepare and publish docker release candidate

Pre requisites:
    Ensure that you are logged in the docker registry and you have access to push to that registry.
    Ensure that docker buildx is enabled for you.

Usage:
    docker_release.py --help
        Get detailed description of argument

    Example command:-
        docker_release <image> --kafka-url <kafka_url> --image-type <type>

        This command will build the multiarch image of type <type> (jvm by default),
        named <image> using <kafka_url> to download kafka and push it to the docker image name <image> provided.
        Make sure image is in the format of <registry>/<namespace>/<image_name>:<image_tag>.
