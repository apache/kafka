/**
 * <p>The sticky assignor serves two purposes. First, it guarantees an assignment that is as balanced as possible, meaning either:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the numbers of topic partitions assigned to consumers differ by at most one; or</li>
 * <li>each consumer that has 2+ fewer topic partitions than some other consumer cannot get any of those topic partitions transferred to it.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Second, it preserved as many existing assignment as possible when a reassignment occurs. This helps in saving some of the
 * overhead processing when topic partitions move from one consumer to another.</p>
 *
 * <p>Starting fresh it would work by distributing the partitions over consumers as evenly as possible. Even though this may sound similar to
 * how round robin assignor works, the second example below shows that it is not.
 * During a reassignment it would perform the reassignment in such a way that in the new assignment
 * <ol>
 * <li>topic partitions are still distributed as evenly as possible, and</li>
 * <li>topic partitions stay with their previously assigned consumers as much as possible.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Of course, the first goal above takes precedence over the second one.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Example 1.</b> Suppose there are three consumers <code>C0</code>, <code>C1</code>, <code>C2</code>,
 * four topics <code>t0,</code> <code>t1</code>, <code>t2</code>, <code>t3</code>, and each topic has 2 partitions,
 * resulting in partitions <code>t0p0</code>, <code>t0p1</code>, <code>t1p0</code>, <code>t1p1</code>, <code>t2p0</code>,
 * <code>t2p1</code>, <code>t3p0</code>, <code>t3p1</code>. Each consumer is subscribed to all three topics.
 *
 * The assignment with both sticky and round robin assignors will be:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>C0: [t0p0, t1p1, t3p0]</code></li>
 * <li><code>C1: [t0p1, t2p0, t3p1]</code></li>
 * <li><code>C2: [t1p0, t2p1]</code></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Now, let's assume <code>C1</code> is removed and a reassignment is about to happen. The round robin assignor would produce:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>C0: [t0p0, t1p0, t2p0, t3p0]</code></li>
 * <li><code>C2: [t0p1, t1p1, t2p1, t3p1]</code></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * while the sticky assignor would result in:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>C0 [t0p0, t1p1, t3p0, t2p0]</code></li>
 * <li><code>C2 [t1p0, t2p1, t0p1, t3p1]</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * preserving all the previous assignments (unlike the round robin assignor).
 *</p>
 * <p><b>Example 2.</b> There are three consumers <code>C0</code>, <code>C1</code>, <code>C2</code>,
 * and three topics <code>t0</code>, <code>t1</code>, <code>t2</code>, with 1, 2, and 3 partitions respectively.
 * Therefore, the partitions are <code>t0p0</code>, <code>t1p0</code>, <code>t1p1</code>, <code>t2p0</code>,
 * <code>t2p1</code>, <code>t2p2</code>. <code>C0</code> is subscribed to <code>t0</code>; <code>C1</code> is subscribed to
 * <code>t0</code>, <code>t1</code>; and <code>C2</code> is subscribed to <code>t0</code>, <code>t1</code>, <code>t2</code>.
 *
 * The round robin assignor would come up with the following assignment:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>C0 [t0p0]</code></li>
 * <li><code>C1 [t1p0]</code></li>
 * <li><code>C2 [t1p1, t2p0, t2p1, t2p2]</code></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * which is not as balanced as the assignment suggested by sticky assignor:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>C0 [t0p0]</code></li>
 * <li><code>C1 [t1p0, t1p1]</code></li>
 * <li><code>C2 [t2p0, t2p1, t2p2]</code></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Now, if consumer <code>C0</code> is removed, these two assignors would produce the following assignments.
 * Round Robin (preserves 3 partition assignments):
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>C1 [t0p0, t1p1]</code></li>
 * <li><code>C2 [t1p0, t2p0, t2p1, t2p2]</code></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Sticky (preserves 5 partition assignments):
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>C1 [t1p0, t1p1, t0p0]</code></li>
 * <li><code>C2 [t2p0, t2p1, t2p2]</code></li>
 * </ul>
 *</p>
 * <h3>Impact on <code>ConsumerRebalanceListener</code></h3>
 * The sticky assignment strategy can provide some optimization to those consumers that have some partition cleanup code
 * in their <code>onPartitionsRevoked()</code> callback listeners. The cleanup code is placed in that callback listener
 * because the consumer has no assumption or hope of preserving any of its assigned partitions after a rebalance when it
 * is using range or round robin assignor. The listener code would look like this:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * class TheOldRebalanceListener implements ConsumerRebalanceListener {
 *
 *   void onPartitionsRevoked(Collection<TopicPartition> partitions) {
 *     for (TopicPartition partition: partitions) {
 *       commitOffsets(partition);
 *       cleanupState(partition);
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   void onPartitionsAssigned(Collection<TopicPartition> partitions) {
 *     for (TopicPartition partition: partitions) {
 *       initializeState(partition);
 *       initializeOffset(partition);
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * As mentioned above, one advantage of the sticky assignor is that, in general, it reduces the number of partitions that
 * actually move from one consumer to another during a reassignment. Therefore, it allows consumers to do their cleanup
 * more efficiently. Of course, they still can perform the partition cleanup in the <code>onPartitionsRevoked()</code>
 * listener, but they can be more efficient and make a note of their partitions before and after the rebalance, and do the
 * cleanup after the rebalance only on the partitions they have lost (which is normally not a lot). The code snippet below
 * clarifies this point:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * class TheNewRebalanceListener implements ConsumerRebalanceListener {
 *   Collection<TopicPartition> lastAssignment = Collections.emptyList();
 *
 *   void onPartitionsRevoked(Collection<TopicPartition> partitions) {
 *     for (TopicPartition partition: partitions)
 *       commitOffsets(partition);
 *   }
 *
 *   void onPartitionsAssigned(Collection<TopicPartition> assignment) {
 *     for (TopicPartition partition: difference(lastAssignment, assignment))
 *       cleanupState(partition);
 *
 *     for (TopicPartition partition: difference(assignment, lastAssignment))
 *       initializeState(partition);
 *
 *     for (TopicPartition partition: assignment)
 *       initializeOffset(partition);
 *
 *     this.lastAssignment = assignment;
 *   }
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Any consumer that uses sticky assignment can leverage this listener like this:
 * <code>consumer.subscribe(topics, new TheNewRebalanceListener());</code>
 *
 * Note that you can leverage the {@link CooperativeStickyAssignor} so that only partitions which are being
 * reassigned to another consumer will be revoked. That is the preferred assignor for newer cluster. See
 * {@link ConsumerPartitionAssignor.RebalanceProtocol} for a detailed explanation of cooperative rebalancing.
